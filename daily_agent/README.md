A hoity-toity grasshopper attempts to understand Earth customs in an underwater city

---

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "Day 437 of my anthropological expedition to this... *underwater metropolis*. I must say, these 'Earth customs' are positively barbaric."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "First observation: humans apparently breathe *air*. AIR! Like some sort of primitive surface creature. How gauche."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "I've been residing in this bubble helmet for months now. It's terribly uncomfortable, but one must make sacrifices for science. And style, obviously."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "The locals here—jellyfish, mostly—keep asking why I don't just... remove the helmet. I tried explaining I'm studying *human* customs, not aquatic ones."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "They stare at me with their gelatinous... well, they don't have eyes, but I *feel* their judgment."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "According to my research, humans engage in something called 'small talk.' Dreadful concept. Just yesterday, I attempted it with a sea cucumber."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "I said, 'Lovely weather we're having, isn't it?' 800 feet below sea level. It didn't respond. Honestly, the rudeness!"

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "Then there's this 'handshake' business. I have six legs! The logistics alone are nightmarish. Do I use the front two? All six in succession?"

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "I attempted a handshake with an octopus last week. It used all eight tentacles. I was offended by the excess."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "My neighbor—a rather rotund pufferfish—suggested I'm in the *wrong location* to study human customs."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "I informed him that I specifically *chose* an underwater city because it's more *refined* than those chaotic surface settlements."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "Besides, I already paid first and last month's rent on this kelp apartment. Do you have any idea how expensive real estate is down here?"

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "The pufferfish also mentioned that I'm not an alien—I'm literally just a grasshopper. A grasshopper FROM Earth."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "Preposterous! I'm clearly far too sophisticated to be from this planet."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "Though now that he mentions it... I *do* have this nagging memory of a field in Kansas..."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "No! No, that must be false memory implantation. Classic Earth custom, surely."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "In any case, I shall continue my research. Today's objective: understanding why humans consume 'sushi' when they could simply... eat the fish alive and whole, like civilized beings."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "Wait, do humans do that? *Should* I be eating fish alive? My notes are somewhat waterlogged."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "*Dramatic sigh* Being a sophisticated alien anthropologist is exhausting."

REGINALD THE GRASSHOPPER: "I think I'll retire to my kelp chambers and contemplate why humans invented 'dry cleaning' when everything could just be... perpetually wet."
