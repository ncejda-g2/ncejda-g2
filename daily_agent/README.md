**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 4**

A philosophical unicorn and a superstitious moose encounter a ghost learning the truth in the astral plane inside a medieval castle

---

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "Ah, the astral plane. Where consciousness transcends the physical and—"

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH THE GLOWING ENTITIES! I brought salt!"

GHOST: "Wait, wait, WAIT. Are you telling me I've been dead for 300 years and NOBODY told me heaven is just... floating shapes?!"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "Heaven is a construct. This is the interconnected web of all consciousness experiencing itself subjectively."

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "I'm knocking on wood! Where's the wood?! EVERYTHING'S ETHEREAL!"

GHOST: "I've been practicing harp for THREE CENTURIES. Where are the clouds? The pearly gates? THE BUFFET?!"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "The buffet was merely a metaphor for spiritual fulfillment."

GHOST: "I DIED AT A BUFFET! I choked on a dinner roll! This was supposed to be my REDEMPTION!"

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "See? This is why I never walk under ladders! Now we're trapped in a dimensional rift!"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "We're not trapped. We're simply observing the ghost's existential awakening."

GHOST: "Existential awakening?! I'm having an EXISTENTIAL BREAKDOWN! I turned down reincarnation for THIS!"

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "Did you break a mirror? Step on a crack? MAKE A WISH AT 11:10 INSTEAD OF 11:11?!"

GHOST: "What? No! I just... I followed the light! Everyone said follow the light!"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "And what did you find?"

GHOST: "A CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK! With a 300-year wait time! I've been in the astral plane's WAITING ROOM!"

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "I KNEW IT! The afterlife has bureaucracy! I'm carrying four rabbit's feet from now on!"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "Perhaps the real heaven was the consciousness you expanded along the way."

GHOST: "The real heaven was SUPPOSED TO HAVE DINNER ROLLS! But NOoo, here I am, floating in cosmic soup with a pretentious unicorn and a moose having a panic attack!"

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "IT'S NOT A PANIC ATTACK, IT'S JUSTIFIED PARANORMAL ANXIETY!"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "Fascinating. The ghost has achieved enlightenment through disappointment."

GHOST: "I haven't achieved ANYTHING! I want a refund!"

SUPERSTITIOUS MOOSE: "Quick! Throw salt over your left shoulder! Oh wait, we don't have shoulders here, WE'RE JUST CONSCIOUSNESS!"

GHOST: "You know what? I'm filing a complaint. Where's the manager of the astral plane?"

PHILOSOPHICAL UNICORN: "We are all the manager of the astral plane."

GHOST and MOOSE: "THAT'S NOT HELPFUL!"
