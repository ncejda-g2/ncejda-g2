# Today's Improv (2026-01-20)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 3**

A friendly ghost, a frugal banshee, and a grumpy man deal with a retirement party where the retiree refuses to leave and barricades themselves in the office in a jungle

CASPER THE GHOST: "Okay everyone, let's give Frank a big round of applause for 40 years of service! Frank? Frank, you can come out now."

FRANK THE MAN: "NO! I'm not retiring! You can't make me!"

WAILING WENDY THE BANSHEE: "Frank, we already bought you a cake. A SMALL cake. From the discount bakery. Please don't waste it."

CASPER THE GHOST: "Buddy, we threw you a whole party! Look, there's... well, there's us. And some very confused monkeys outside the window."

FRANK THE MAN: "This office is my LIFE! I've got 17 staplers in here and a coffee mug collection that spans three decades!"

WAILING WENDY THE BANSHEE: "Frank, do you know how much we spent on streamers? $3.47. I could've gotten TWO rotisserie chickens for that."

FRANK THE MAN: "I'VE BARRICADED THE DOOR WITH FILING CABINETS! THERE ARE SPREADSHEETS IN THERE FROM 1987!"

CASPER THE GHOST: "Frank, I could literally just phase through the wall and open the door from the inside."

FRANK THE MAN: "Don't you DARE! This is MY domain! Who's going to organize the quarterly reports?!"

WAILING WENDY THE BANSHEE: "We hired your replacement last week. She's 23 and knows what TikTok is."

FRANK THE MAN: "TRAITORS!"

CASPER THE GHOST: "Look, I'm going to level with you. I've been dead for 80 years, and even I know when it's time to move on."

MONKEY: *crashes through window* "OOH OOH AH AH!"

FRANK THE MAN: "SECURITY! Oh wait, I was also the security guard."

WAILING WENDY THE BANSHEE: "Frank, that monkey just ate your retirement cake. The cake I PAID FOR."

CASPER THE GHOST: "Wendy, I think we have bigger problems. Frank just shoved a desk against the—"

FRANK THE MAN: "I'M SETTING UP A PERIMETER! I've got three hole punchers and I'm not afraid to use them!"

WAILING WENDY THE BANSHEE: "You know what? Fine. Stay in there. But you're not getting your $50 gift card to Applebee's."

FRANK THE MAN: "...What's the expiration date on that gift card?"

CASPER THE GHOST: "It expires tomorrow."

FRANK THE MAN: *door slowly opens* "I may have been... hasty."

WAILING WENDY THE BANSHEE: "That's what I thought. Also, you're paying me back $1.74 for half that cake. The monkey only ate half."
