# Today's Improv (2026-01-14)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 2**

A rockstar oak tree, an egomaniacal ghoul, and a vindictive fox deal with a bad chef who comes to their underwater town

---

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Dudes, we need to talk about the new restaurant. 'Chef Barnacle's Bistro.' I went there last night and—"

MORTIMER THE GHOUL: "YOU went there? *I* went there. I'm the one who truly experienced it. My refined palate suffered immeasurably."

SCARLETT THE FOX: "Oh, you both went without me? How delightful. I'll remember that."

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Scarlett, it's not like that, man. We were gonna invite you but—"

SCARLETT THE FOX: "Save it. What did this chef do that's worth discussing?"

MORTIMER THE GHOUL: "What did he DO? He served me a kelp soufflé that had the texture of a deflated beach ball. It was an affront to MY existence specifically."

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Bro, he gave me 'wood-fired seaweed.' I'm made of WOOD. That's like... cannibalism adjacent?"

SCARLETT THE FOX: "Fascinating. And neither of you thought to warn me before I made a reservation for tonight."

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Wait, you made a reservation? After we just said—"

SCARLETT THE FOX: "Oh, I'm going. But not to eat. I'm going to make sure everyone in this underwater town knows exactly what I think of his 'cuisine.'"

MORTIMER THE GHOUL: "Please, the vendetta should be MINE. I'm the one with discerning taste. I've been dead for 300 years! I know what good rot tastes like!"

CHEF BARNACLE: *swims by* "Ah! My first reviewers! Did you enjoy my interpretive dishes?"

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Uh, chef, dude, maybe go easier on the salt water? Everything tasted like... well, the ocean."

CHEF BARNACLE: "That's the POINT! We're underwater! I'm a genius!"

MORTIMER THE GHOUL: "Genius? GENIUS? I'll have you know I've dined with kings, queens, and several angry mobs! Your 'sea cucumber surprise' was only surprising in its mediocrity!"

SCARLETT THE FOX: "Your restaurant has a one-star review now. From me. Posted five minutes ago. Before I even ate there."

CHEF BARNACLE: "But... you haven't tried my food!"

SCARLETT THE FOX: "I don't need to. These two didn't invite me to their dinner, so now everyone suffers. Also, your sign has a typo."

CHEF BARNACLE: *swimming away in tears* "I just wanted to share my passion for oceanic fusion cuisine!"

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Man, that was harsh. Even for underwater restaurant drama."

MORTIMER THE GHOUL: "Harsh? I was planning to haunt his kitchen for the next decade! This is mercy!"

SCARLETT THE FOX: "You know what? I'm going to write a follow-up review saying the chef cried when confronted with criticism. That should boost engagement."

OAKLEY THE OAK TREE: "Remind me to never forget to invite you to anything ever again."

MORTIMER THE GHOUL: "Agreed. Though I maintain that *I* was the primary victim here."

SCARLETT THE FOX: "You're both victims of your own poor judgment. I, however, am a victim of your poor planning. There's a difference."
