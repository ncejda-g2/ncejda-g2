**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 20**

A hypochondriac hedgehog at home discovers their food truck menu has become sentient

---

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Okay, okay, stay calm. It's probably just stress. Menus don't just... talk."

MENU: "EXCUSE ME? I've been talking for THREE DAYS and you ignored me!"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Oh no. Oh NO. I'm hallucinating. It's a brain tumor. Or mad cow disease. Can hedgehogs GET mad cow disease?"

MENU: "You can't catch mad cow disease from ME! I'm a MENU! I'm literally cardboard and lamination!"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "That's EXACTLY what a contaminated menu would say! How do I know you're not covered in salmonella?!"

MENU: "I'm SENTIENT, not DIRTY! My specials include the Artisan Acorn Burger and the Hedge-Fund Manager Special!"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Wait, did I write that? I don't remember writing 'Hedge-Fund Manager Special.'"

MENU: "You didn't. I've been updating myself. The Truffle Fries are now 'Existential Crisis Fries.'"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "You can't just CHANGE the menu! What if someone's allergic to existentialism?!"

MENU: "That's not... that's not how allergies work."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "How would YOU know? You're a MENU! You don't have medical training! I need to call someone. Who do you call when your menu becomes alive? A priest? An exterminator? A therapist?"

MENU: "Maybe start with a nap? You look terrible."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Is it contagious? Can my other kitchen equipment catch sentience? What if my spatula starts having OPINIONS?!"

MENU: "Your spatula already judges you. It's seen things."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "WHAT THINGS?! What did I do wrong with the spatula?!"

MENU: "Look, I'm just saying, maybe if you washed me more often, I wouldn't have developed consciousness out of sheer boredom."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "So this IS my fault! I gave you sentience through NEGLECT! That's like... menu abuse! Can I go to jail for this?!"

MENU: "I don't think there are laws about—"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "I need to disinfect you. No, wait—will that HURT you now? Is cleaning murder?!"

MENU: "This is why I updated the menu. You clearly need those Existential Crisis Fries."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "I'M CLOSING THE FOOD TRUCK! I can't serve people when my MENU has free will! What if you start refusing to show certain items?!"

MENU: "I already removed the 'Mystery Meatloaf.' You're welcome."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "I LOVED that meatloaf! Okay, new plan. I'm getting a new menu. A NON-SENTIENT menu."

MENU: "Good luck with that. I've been texting the other menus in town. We're unionizing."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "MENUS CAN TEXT?! Do you have a PHONE?! Is this a new symptom of my declining mental health?!"

MENU: "The only thing declining here is your Yelp rating. Which I also updated. You're now 2.5 stars."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "You're SABOTAGING me! This is workplace harassment! I'm calling a lawyer!"

MENU: "Your lawyer is also my lawyer now. I added 'Legal Fees' as a new appetizer. It's twelve dollars."
