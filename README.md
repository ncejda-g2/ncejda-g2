# Today's Improv (2026-02-10)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 59**

A friendly grasshopper, a jittery spider, and a grandiose squirrel work as couples therapists mediating between a volcano and the village that keeps trying to appease it with sacrifices on an alien planet

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "Thank you both for coming to today's session. I know this has been... explosive."

JITTERY SPIDER: "I-I represent the village council and we just want to say—we're SORRY! We'll sacrifice MORE goats! Better goats! Organic, free-range goats!"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "I speak for the MIGHTY VOLCANO, whose fury is LEGENDARY across this alien landscape! The volcano demands RESPECT, not... goats."

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "Okay, let's use our 'I feel' statements. Volcano, can you express what you're really feeling?"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "The volcano feels... *adjusts imaginary monocle* UNDERAPPRECIATED. For millennia, the volcano has provided geothermal energy, fertile soil, and dramatic sunsets. And what does it get? Dead livestock tossed into its crater!"

JITTERY SPIDER: "But that's h-how you show respect to a volcano! It's tradition! Our ancestors did it, and THEIR ancestors—"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "Your ancestors were WRONG! The volcano doesn't WANT goats! It's LACTOSE INTOLERANT!"

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "This is a breakthrough. So the sacrifices actually cause... discomfort?"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "The volcano erupts because of INDIGESTION, not RAGE! Each goat causes seismic reflux!"

JITTERY SPIDER: "*trembling* B-but we thought the eruptions meant you wanted MORE sacrifices!"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "A vicious cycle of dairy-based misunderstanding!"

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "I'm sensing a communication breakdown. Village, what do YOU need from this relationship?"

JITTERY SPIDER: "We just... we don't want to be incinerated? Our houses are made of space-bamboo! Very flammable!"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "The volcano has NO INTENTION of destroying you! It simply requires... acknowledgment. Perhaps a plaque? 'Thank you for the lava flows and scenic vistas.'"

JITTERY SPIDER: "That's IT? Just a PLAQUE?!"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "And maybe stop dumping your trash in the crater. The volcano is not a landfill. It has FEELINGS."

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "This is excellent progress! Village, can you commit to no more sacrifices?"

JITTERY SPIDER: "Y-yes! Absolutely! We'll install the plaque! We'll even make it bilingual—Common and Magma!"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "The volcano is... moved. Emotionally, not tectonically. For once."

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "Beautiful. Now, let's schedule a follow-up in two weeks to—"

*Distant rumbling*

JITTERY SPIDER: "*panicking* What was THAT?!"

GRANDIOSE SQUIRREL: "The volcano says... that was the NEIGHBORING volcano. He's single and causes problems."

FRIENDLY GRASSHOPPER: "I'll get my appointment book."
