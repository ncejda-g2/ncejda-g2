# Today's Improv (2026-03-02)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 79**

An egomaniacal ant and a sleepy giraffe attempt retirement planning in Dreamland, where the most ambitious financial goal on the table is surviving until next Wednesday

---

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "Welcome to the offices of Reginald Q. Antsworth III — the greatest retirement planner in all of Dreamland, and possibly the broader dream multiverse."

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "Mmm. Yes. Sorry. I may have dozed off on the elevator up. Where are we again?"

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "My office. We are here to discuss your retirement portfolio. Shall we begin building your LEGACY?"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "Sure. So... how do we make sure I have enough to last until, let's say... nap time?"

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "Nap time. You want a retirement plan that covers until... nap time."

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "Or possibly lunch. If I'm feeling aggressive."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "I restructured the Cloud King's diversified portfolio! I built seventeen-generation compound interest plans for the Sand Worm of Sector Four! And your horizon is LUNCH?"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "I'm not sure I have grandchildren. I barely have a Thursday."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "What do you mean you 'barely have a Thursday'?"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "I mean I've been awake for about forty minutes and I'm already fading. Can we set something small? A nice dream by 3pm? With a hammock in it?"

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "A hammock. You want me to plan for a hammock."

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "A *nice* hammock. Good light. And possibly a leafy snack around 2."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "I am going to need you to think BIGGER. Think DECADES. Think CENTURIES."

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "I'm thinking about right now. And right now I'm already planning my next blink."

UNHINGED SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "IGNORE HIM! I offer SHORT-TERM investments! Day-trading in naps! Your dreams as collateral! TWELVE SNOOZE BUTTONS gets you a fixed rate! SIGN HERE!"

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "Get OUT of my office, Gerald! You are not even licensed in Dreamland!"

UNHINGED SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "I'm licensed in THREE parallel daydreams AND a fever dream! My rates are unbeatable and my paperwork is mostly edible!"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "...He does seem to understand my needs."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "Gerald was BANNED from the Dreamland Financial Exchange for charging interest in units of snooze buttons. He is a vegetable."

UNHINGED SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "The snooze button standard is MORE STABLE than the gold standard! The nap market NEVER CRASHES!"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "I do have twelve snooze buttons saved up..."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "Fine. FINE. What is your absolute maximum planning horizon? Your most ambitious dream?"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "...Next Wednesday. If I'm feeling bold."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "I have never said these words in my professional career: let's build a five-day retirement plan."

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "Could we do four? I'll probably be asleep by Tuesday."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "FOUR-DAY RETIREMENT PLAN. Goals: one hammock dream, two leafy snacks, and a modest savings bond maturing by Friday at noon—"

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "Oh, sorry. I fell asleep for a moment there. What were we discussing?"

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "Your retirement."

SLEEPY GIRAFFE: "Oh. That's so far away."

EGOMANIACAL ANT: "...It is Wednesday."
