# Today's Improv (2025-12-24)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 11**

A wise fox performs a musical monologue at the edge of an active volcano where every line must be sung

---

WISE FOX: "🎵 I've climbed this mountain for wisdom and truth! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 But now I'm regretting my hiking boots! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 The lava is rising, my fur is singed! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Perhaps this volcano trip wasn't well-hinged! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 They said 'Go seek enlightenment up high!' 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Nobody mentioned I might literally fry! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 I'm wise, they tell me, I'm cunning, I'm sly! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Yet here I stand about to die! 🎵"

TOURIST BIRD: "*flying past* 🎵 Excuse me, is this the scenic route? 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 It's LAVA, my friend, please don't be cute! 🎵"

TOURIST BIRD: "🎵 Oh right, well, have a lovely day! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 THE GROUND IS MELTING, FLY AWAY! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Now where was I? Oh yes, my plight! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Standing on magma, this isn't right! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 I came here seeking ancient knowledge! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Should've just gone to community college! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 The prophecy spoke of flames and fire! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 I thought it was metaphorical desire! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 But no, it's ACTUAL fire down there! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Burning my tail and ruining my hair! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 You know what's truly wise, I now see? 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Not every lesson requires a degree! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 In three-hundred-ninety-eight Celsius! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Wait, why am I STILL singing this?! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 I cannot stop! It's like a curse! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Everything comes out in musical verse! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Even my screams have perfect pitch! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 This volcano's got some kind of switch! 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 The real wisdom here, if I may confess... 🎵"

WISE FOX: "🎵 Is Google Maps reviews, I should have checked those, yes! 🎵"
