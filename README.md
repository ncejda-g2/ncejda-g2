HOITY-TOITY DINOSAUR: "Welcome to my parlor, er, living room. I'm conducting interviews for my new venture—a luxury artisanal dirt tasting company. Your resume says you eat hay off the ground?"

UGLY HORSE: "Yeah, that's right. Been doing it for years. Sometimes I find rocks in there, add a nice crunch."

HOITY-TOITY DINOSAUR: "Exquisite! But tell me, do you have any experience with *discerning* palates? Can you distinguish between a 2024 backyard loam and a 2023 front lawn clay?"

UGLY HORSE: "Well, I once ate mud from a puddle and threw up. Does that count as feedback?"

HOITY-TOITY DINOSAUR: "Brilliant! Visceral reviews are all the rage. Now, the position requires extensive travel—rolling around in various dirt patches across the continent. Are you prepared to get absolutely filthy while maintaining an air of sophistication?"

UGLY HORSE: "Look at me. I'm already ugly. Sophistication left the barn a long time ago. But I can roll in dirt like nobody's business."

HOITY-TOITY DINOSAUR: "Hmm, I appreciate your honesty, but our brand is 'repugnantly refined.' Can you sneer while eating dirt?"

UGLY HORSE: "Buddy, I sneer at my own reflection. I can definitely sneer at dirt."

HOITY-TOITY DINOSAUR: "Marvelous! You're hired! Your first assignment is to taste-test the carpet fibers in my guest bedroom. I've been seasoning them with pretension for months."

UGLY HORSE: "Do I get dental?"

HOITY-TOITY DINOSAUR: "Darling, you'll be eating dirt. You'll NEED dental."
