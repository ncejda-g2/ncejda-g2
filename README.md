A wizard grasshopper interviews for an absurd position in the desert

---

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Thank you for seeing me. Yes, I hopped here. It took three weeks."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "So, 'Sand Counter.' That's the official title? Not 'Granular Inventory Specialist' or something?"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Right. Counting sand. In the desert. Where there is... an abundance of sand."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "I see. And the pay is?"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "One grain per grain counted. That's... that's not even a ratio that makes sense."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Look, I'm a wizard. I have a degree in Mystical Arts from Toad University. I can conjure fire, teleport small objects—"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "No, I can't teleport sand. That's... oddly specific. Why would I—"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "THAT'S what you need?! Someone who can teleport sand?!"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Wait, let me get this straight. You hire someone to COUNT the sand, then you hire a DIFFERENT person to teleport it? Why not just... keep the sand where it is?"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "The government requires an accurate count. The GOVERNMENT. Of SAND. In a DESERT."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "You know what, forget the pay. Let's talk benefits. Do you offer health insurance?"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "A coupon for cactus juice. One coupon. For the year."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "I'm six millimeters tall. How much cactus juice do you think I—actually, why am I arguing? This is insane."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "And yet... I did hop for three weeks to get here. The job market is TERRIBLE right now."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Fine. I'll take it. But I'm unionizing the sand. Every grain gets collective bargaining rights."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "What do you MEAN that's forbidden?!"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Section 47, Subsection Q: 'No employee shall radicalize geological formations'?! That's the most dystopian thing I've ever—"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "You know what? I'm out. I'd rather cast spells at children's birthday parties. At least there, the screaming makes sense."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Wait, you're saying other candidates WANT this job?"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "A sentient dune? You're interviewing a SENTIENT DUNE for the position of SAND COUNTER?!"

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "That's nepotism! That's blatant— you know what, fine. FINE. I hope you and the dune are very happy together."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Three weeks hopping back. Three weeks. I should've learned corporate law instead of magic."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Although... I wonder if the dune needs a wizard assistant? No. No. I have SOME dignity left."

WIZARD GRASSHOPPER: "Mostly."
