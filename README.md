# Today's Improv (2026-01-06)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 24**

A hippie capybara, a hoity-toity imaginary friend, and an egomaniacal cat deal with ghosts haunting their home comedy club

---

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "Dudes, I'm sensing some seriously negative energy in here. The spirits are, like, totally harshing the vibe."

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "The only thing harshing the vibe is that you turned our living room into a 'comedy club' without consulting ME, the obvious star of this household."

HOITY-TOITY IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I must say, having comedy shows in one's parlor is rather déclassé. In my day, we haunted PROPER establishments."

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "Wait, you're a ghost?"

HOITY-TOITY IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Imaginary friend, darling. Though the distinction seems to elude most people."

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "Can we focus? I have a set in five minutes and the spotlight keeps flickering!"

GHOST COMEDIAN: *materializes on stage* "Is this thing on? Testing, testing... BOO!"

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "Whoa, man! A ghost comedian! That's so cosmically aligned!"

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "EXCUSE ME. This is MY stage time. I have seventeen minutes of gold material about how I'm better than dogs."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "Get in line, furball. I've been DYING to do this set. Get it? DYING?"

HOITY-TOITY IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Oh dear, puns. How pedestrian."

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "Your material is literally dead on arrival."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "That's rich coming from someone whose entire act is knocking things off tables!"

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "Guys, guys, we're all just energy, man. Can't we share the stage in harmony?"

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "Absolutely not. I'm calling an exorcist."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "You can't exorcise me from MY OWN COMEDY CLUB. I died here in 1987 after my closing joke bombed!"

HOITY-TOITY IMAGINARY FRIEND: "How delightfully tragic. What was the joke?"

GHOST COMEDIAN: "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "Oh no..."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "To get to the OTHER SIDE. Get it? The other side? Like, the afterlife?"

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "You deserved to die."

HOITY-TOITY IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I've never agreed with a cat more fervently."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "THAT'S why I'm still here! No one appreciated my GENIUS!"

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "Dude, maybe you're stuck here because you need closure, man. Like, spiritual fulfillment through laughter?"

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "Or because your jokes are so bad even the afterlife rejected you."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "Oh yeah? Let's have a GHOST-OFF! You, me, five minutes each. Winner gets the stage."

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "Deal. Prepare to be DESTROYED."

HOITY-TOITY IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I'll judge. I have impeccable taste."

HIPPIE CAPYBARA: "I'll just be here radiating positive energy and emotional support!"

GHOST COMEDIAN: "Knock knock."

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "I'm not doing this."

GHOST COMEDIAN: "KNOCK. KNOCK."

EVERYONE: "Who's there?"

GHOST COMEDIAN: "Boo."

EGOMANIACAL CAT: "If you say 'Boo who' I'm getting holy water."
