*'Oh, hey Mom. No, nothing important, just at work.'*

### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** A hungry lemur working at NASA Mission Control during a critical Mars landing spots a pizza delivery guy through the window. The lemur's stomach growls so loud it echoes through the headset, and an astronaut radios: "Houston, what was that sonic boom?"

**Panel 2:** The lemur casually answers the phone mid-countdown saying "Oh hey, Pizza Palace? Yeah, one large pepperoni. Address? Just tell the driver to look for the building with the 50-foot satellite dishes. Oh, T-minus 30 seconds to what? Nothing important, just at work."

**Panel 3:** The entire mission control team watches in horror as the lemur ignores all the alarms and flashing red lights to pay the delivery driver. The Mars rover lands perfectly on its own, but sends back its first photo: a selfie with a note saying "DID IT MYSELF. THANKS FOR NOTHING, HUNGRY LEMUR." Meanwhile, the lemur is already on slice number seven, completely oblivious.
