# Today's Improv (2026-02-05)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 54**

A hoity-toity sloth, a gregarious banshee, and an enlightened moose are time travelers trying to fit into a different era in Candyland

---

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "I say, is this... confectionery... meant to be architecture? How frightfully gauche."

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?! Hi! Hello! Are you made of candy too?!" *approaches a gumdrop house*

ENLIGHTENED MOOSE: "We must embrace this reality. We are one with the frosting. The frosting is one with us."

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "The frosting is giving me hives. And would someone please explain why everything is... sticky?"

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF CANDY! Want to be friends?! What year is this?! I LOVE MAKING NEW FRIENDS!"

ENLIGHTENED MOOSE: "Time is an illusion. We exist in all eras simultaneously. Also, I just stepped in a chocolate river."

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "This is precisely why I opposed time travel. Look at us - covered in sprinkles, talking to lollipops..."

CANDY CANE VILLAGER: *walks by* "You folks tourists?"

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "YES! From the future! And also the past! WE'RE TIME TRAVELERS! What's YOUR name?!"

CANDY CANE VILLAGER: "...You need to leave. You're scaring the gingerbread children."

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "Madam, I am a distinguished temporal explorer. I do NOT 'scare children.'"

ENLIGHTENED MOOSE: "We are all children in the cosmic candy store of existence."

CANDY CANE VILLAGER: *backs away slowly* "I'm calling the Gingerbread Guard."

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "WAIT! Can we get your autograph first?! I've never met a candy cane person before!"

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "This is humiliating. In my time, we had PROPER architecture. Made of... not food."

ENLIGHTENED MOOSE: "Perhaps we are the food. Have you considered that?"

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "I absolutely have NOT considered that, and I shan't start now!"

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "HEY EVERYONE! We're from another time! Anyone want to exchange cultural customs?!"

GINGERBREAD GUARD: *arrives* "Alright, what's the disturbance?"

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "Officer, thank goodness. Could you direct us to the temporal portal? We clearly don't belong here."

GINGERBREAD GUARD: "The what now?"

ENLIGHTENED MOOSE: "He seeks the doorway between moments. The threshold of when and now."

GINGERBREAD GUARD: "Are you three... on sugar?"

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "NO! We're time travelers! From different eras! Trying to blend in! How are we doing?!"

GINGERBREAD GUARD: "Terribly."

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "I could have told them that. I've been saying that since we arrived."

ENLIGHTENED MOOSE: "To blend is to dissolve the ego. Perhaps that is the lesson Candyland teaches us."

GREGARIOUS BANSHEE: "OR we could just eat our way out! Everything's edible! THIS IS THE BEST ERA EVER!"

HOITY-TOITY SLOTH: "That's it. I'm filing a complaint with the Time Travel Bureau."

GINGERBREAD GUARD: "The... you know what, I don't get paid enough for this. Just stay away from the Lollipop Guild."
