*Every year: 'It's <year>--I want my jetpack [and also my free medical care covering all my jetpack-related injuries]!'*

### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:**
A wise penguin waddles into a tech store asking, "Do you have jetpacks?" The friendly hedgehog clerk replies, "Yes, but they come with mandatory insurance for crash-related quill loss."

**Panel 2:**
The cheerful otter bounces in shouting, "I'll take ten jetpacks!" The penguin asks, "Why ten?" The otter grins, "I keep crashing them into lakes, but joke's on physics—I'm amphibious!"

**Panel 3:**
Six months later, the hedgehog processes the otter's 47th insurance claim. The otter floats by the window in a inner tube attached to balloons, giving a thumbs up. "I innovated," says a soggy note tied to a fish.
