# Today's Improv (2026-02-22)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 71**

A hypocritical raccoon conducts job interviews deep in the swamp, where a delusional banshee and an oblivious E. coli apply for a position with the most peculiar skills imaginable

---

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "Welcome to SwampCorp. I am looking for candidates who are punctual, honest, and absolutely do not steal food from communal refrigerators." *slides stolen sandwich further under desk*

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "I've already mentally redecorated my future office. Exposed algae beams. Very swamp-chic."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "Excuse me, is this the line for the swamp tour? I was told there would be snacks."

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "This is a job interview. Please sit. Question one: describe your greatest weakness."

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "My greatest weakness is that I care too much. Also, my screams have caused three structural collapses. But mostly the caring."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "Sunlight. Dry surfaces. Antibiotics. Are you writing this down? You're writing this down."

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "I am absolutely NOT taking notes." *writes furiously*

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "Actually, I'd like to retract the weaknesses. Everything I said was a strength in disguise. Please update your records."

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "Question two: where do you see yourself in five years?"

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "Probably on a doorknob somewhere. A buffet table if things go well."

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "Running this swamp. The adjacent wetlands. And frankly, the estuary."

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "You're applying for Junior Bog Monitor."

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "Yes. A stepping stone."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "What's the position? Is it outdoors? I reproduce very fast in outdoor settings."

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: *under breath* "I have made a catastrophic error posting this listing on CraigsWamp."

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "I should mention I have seventeen years of relevant experience. I have also been alive for eighteen years, so make of that what you will."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "Can I ask about the benefits package? Specifically, the buffet?"

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "There is no buffet. This is a bog. Final question: what unique skills do you bring to this role?"

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "I have never once doubted myself. My wail can also shatter self-confidence at fifty paces. I consider that a management skill."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "I can divide into two million copies in under twenty minutes. I'm a team player. Very much a team player."

*long silence*

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "I'm going to be completely transparent. I already hired my cousin. This process was a legal formality."

DELUSIONAL BANSHEE: "I KNEW IT. I am the most qualified candidate to be wrongfully passed over in this swamp's entire hiring history."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "So... no tour?"

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: "No tour."

OBLIVIOUS E. COLI: "I've already reproduced on three of your chairs, by the way. Complimentary. Consider it a parting gift."

HYPOCRITICAL RACCOON: *staring at chairs* "...We're going to need a bigger bog."
