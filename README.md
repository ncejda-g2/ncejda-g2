A ninja llama interviews for a position as Chief Bubble Inspector in an underwater city

---

NINJA LLAMA: "Okay, okay, I've got this. I'm a ninja. I'm stealthy. I'm trained for anything. How hard can a job interview be?"

NINJA LLAMA: "Wait, why is the chair floating? Oh right. Underwater city. Should've read the fine print."

NINJA LLAMA: "And why did I wear my traditional ninja garb to this? I look like a wet black sock with ears."

INTERVIEWER FISH: *swims by with clipboard* "Are you the 3 o'clock for Chief Bubble Inspector?"

NINJA LLAMA: "YES! I mean... yes. Professional. I am very professional at... inspecting... bubbles."

INTERVIEWER FISH: *swims away*

NINJA LLAMA: "Did that go well? I can't tell. He just blinked at me. Do fish blink? Was that approval or confusion?"

NINJA LLAMA: "Focus. You prepared for this. What did the job posting say? 'Must have keen eye for detail, ability to work under pressure—' oh, THAT'S a pun. Under pressure. Because we're underwater. They're mocking me already."

NINJA LLAMA: "But I NEED this job. Do you know how hard it is to find ninja work these days? Everyone's got security cameras! My last seventeen missions failed because some human saw me on their Ring doorbell!"

NINJA LLAMA: "So I thought, 'What's a place with NO cameras? The ocean floor!' Brilliant! Except now I'm applying to inspect BUBBLES."

NINJA LLAMA: "What does that even mean? Do I just... look at them? 'Yep, that's a bubble. Nice and round. Good bubble.'"

INTERVIEWER FISH: *returns* "Question one: What makes you qualified for this position?"

NINJA LLAMA: "I—I have extensive experience in stealth, which translates to careful observation without disturbing the environment—"

INTERVIEWER FISH: "Can you pop a bubble with a shuriken from fifty yards?"

NINJA LLAMA: "I... what? Yes? I mean, I could, but wouldn't that defeat the purpose of INSPECTING—"

INTERVIEWER FISH: *deadpan* "You're hired. Start Monday. Don't be late."

NINJA LLAMA: "Wait, THAT'S what qualified me?! I spent three weeks practicing my handshake technique for NOTHING?!"

INTERVIEWER FISH: *swimming away* "Oh, and llamas don't have hands."

NINJA LLAMA: "...I really need to update my resume."
