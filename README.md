# Today's Improv (2025-12-30)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 17**

A zombie capybara and an upset hedgehog are time travelers trying to fit into a different era in the city

---

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "Okay, so we're in 1920s New York. Just act natural."

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "*looking down at self* Natural?! I'm a HEDGEHOG wearing a FEDORA! Nothing about this is natural!"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*adjusting monocle with decaying paw* At least you're not UNDEAD. Do you know how hard it is to explain why bits of you keep falling off?"

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "We've been here five minutes and you've already lost two toes and an ear! People are STARING!"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "They're staring because you keep poking people when you get anxious. That businessman is bleeding."

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "It's a STRESS RESPONSE! And maybe if someone hadn't set the time machine to 'Random Century,' I wouldn't BE stressed!"

FLAPPER: "*walks by* Oh my stars, what ADORABLE costumes! Are you two headed to a speakeasy?"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*brain working slowly* Uh... yes. Speakeasy. We speak... easy."

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "*whispering* That doesn't even make sense!"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*whispering back while jaw falls off* I'M DOING MY BEST, GERALD!"

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "And NOW your jaw is on the sidewalk! How are you going to explain THAT?!"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*picks up jaw, reattaches it backwards* Dental... emergency?"

FLAPPER: "Oh heavens, you poor thing! My dentist is just around the corner!"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*muffled, jaw still backwards* No thank sssss!"

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "*panicking* We need to get back to the time machine IMMEDIATELY before—"

POLICE OFFICER: "*approaching* Say, you two look suspicious. What's your business here?"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*jaw falling off again* Sssssspeakeasssssy!"

POLICE OFFICER: "Are you having a stroke, sir?"

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "He's fine! We're just very method actors! We're rehearsing for a play called 'When Animals Time Travel and Everything Goes Wrong!'"

POLICE OFFICER: "*squinting* That's oddly specific."

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "It's EXPERIMENTAL THEATER!"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*finally gets jaw right* Yes! Very experimental! I play a capybara who questions mortality!"

POLICE OFFICER: "A capa-what now?"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "It's a South American rodent! Very big! Very chill! Usually not dead!"

POLICE OFFICER: "*backing away slowly* You folks just... stay away from the speakeasies."

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "*as officer leaves* Okay, we're leaving RIGHT NOW before—"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "*ear falls into storm drain* Oops."

UPSET HEDGEHOG: "I'm setting the time machine to 'Literally Anywhere Else.'"

ZOMBIE CAPYBARA: "Can we at least stop by 3025? I want to see if they've invented ear replacements."
