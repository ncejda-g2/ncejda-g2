A down-to-earth imaginary friend underwater learns the truth in the astral plane

---

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Okay, so... I'm dead. Well, not 'dead' dead—I was never technically alive. But I'm GHOST dead now, which is like... meta-death? Death squared?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "And apparently, when imaginary friends die, we don't go to Heaven OR Hell. We go to the ASTRAL PLANE. Which, let me tell you, is just underwater. Regular underwater. Like, with fish and kelp and everything."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I've been here three days trying to figure out the deeper meaning, and I just realized—there ISN'T one. This is it. The great cosmic truth is that the afterlife for imaginary beings is... the ocean."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "A seahorse just floated by. I asked him if he knew the meaning of existence. He ate some plankton and swam away. That's... that's the whole spiritual journey."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "You know what the worst part is? I spent eight years with a kid named Trevor, right? Trevor couldn't sleep without me. Needed me for EVERYTHING. Bedtime stories, math homework, dealing with bullies."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Then one day—POOF. He turns eleven and suddenly he's 'too old for imaginary friends.' And where do I go? STRAIGHT to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to contemplate my non-existence."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "There's not even a welcome committee! I thought there'd be, like, a wise old spirit guide or something. Nope. Just a crab with attitude problems."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Oh, and here's the kicker—I can see THROUGH the astral plane into Trevor's room. He's fine, by the way. Got a gaming PC now. Doesn't need existential conversations at 2 AM anymore. Just needs better WiFi."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Meanwhile, I'm stuck here having an identity crisis next to a very judgmental octopus. His name is Gerald. Gerald thinks I'm 'too negative.'"

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "GERALD, I'M A GHOST OF AN IMAGINARY BEING TRAPPED UNDERWATER IN THE ASTRAL PLANE. I think a LITTLE negativity is warranted!"

GERALD THE OCTOPUS: "Still sounds like a you problem."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "See?! THIS is enlightenment? THIS is the truth I was supposed to learn?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I thought there'd be answers here. Like, 'What's my purpose?' or 'Did I make a difference?' But no. The truth is just... we fade. Kids grow up. And imaginary friends end up in the astral plane arguing with cephalopods."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "You know what? Fine. FINE. If this is where I'm spending eternity, I'm at least going to organize it. These starfish are EVERYWHERE. No structure. No system."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I'm starting a community board. We're going to have RULES. Meeting minutes. Maybe a potluck—wait, do ghosts eat? Can I eat seaweed? Gerald, can I eat seaweed?!"

GERALD THE OCTOPUS: "You're yelling again."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Because I'M HAVING AN EPIPHANY, GERALD! The truth isn't some mystical revelation! The truth is that even in the afterlife, someone's gotta take charge and make things less weird!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I'm gonna be the most DOWN-TO-EARTH ghost this astral plane has ever seen. Clipboard, schedules, maybe a newsletter. We're bringing ORDER to the cosmic void!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Trevor didn't need me anymore, but you know what? These disorganized sea creatures DO. This is my purpose now."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "The truth I learned? Sometimes you don't transcend. Sometimes you just... reorganize the filing system. And honestly? I'm okay with that."

GERALD THE OCTOPUS: "You're still standing on my house."

DOWN-TO-EARTH IMAGINARY FRIEND: "THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO ZONING LAWS, GERALD! See? This is exactly what I'm talking about!"
