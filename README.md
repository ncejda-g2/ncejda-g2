A conspiratorial man performs in an Arctic comedy club haunted by ghosts

---

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "So I finally got this gig at the Arctic Comedy Club. You know WHY it's in the Arctic? Because THEY don't want you to know the truth about comedy!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "Notice how there's no wifi up here? That's not an accident, people. They can't track your laughter if you're off the grid."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "And another thing—this place is haunted. OBVIOUSLY haunted. But the government won't acknowledge it because ghosts don't pay taxes!"

GHOST HECKLER: *faint whisper* "Booooo..."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "SEE?! You all heard that, right? Or are you all IN ON IT?"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "I've done my research. This comedy club was built on an ancient penguin burial ground. Connect the dots, people!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "The owners claim it's just 'wind through the ventilation.' Wind? IN A SEALED BUNKER? Wake up, sheeple!"

GHOST HECKLER: "Get off the stage..."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "That's what THEY want me to do! Classic misdirection! But I've prepared for this. I brought sage, holy water, and a whiteboard with seventeen interconnected theories!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "Fun fact: every comedian who's performed here has mysteriously had their set 'bomb.' Coincidence? I. Think. NOT."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "The ghosts are working with Big Comedy to suppress the truth. They haunt anyone who gets too close to exposing the algorithm!"

GHOST HECKLER: "There is no algorithm. We're just dead."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "EXACTLY what a government agent would say! You're glowing, ghost! I can see right through you—literally AND metaphorically!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "Why the Arctic? Because the ice preserves evidence. Also, the auroras? Those are DATA STREAMS. I have diagrams."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "I know what you're thinking: 'This guy's crazy.' That's what they programmed you to think! But I have proof!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: *pulls out a notebook covered in scribbles* "Look at this. Page 47. A ghost laughed at my joke in 2019. Why? To make me COMPLACENT."

GHOST HECKLER: "That wasn't me. I died in 1987."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "Ah-HA! So you ADMIT there's a NETWORK of ghosts! How many of you are there? WHO'S YOUR HANDLER?!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "I bet you're all connected to the same ethereal mainframe. Probably running on blockchain. Ghost-chain. I should trademark that."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "You know what's funny? And by funny, I mean SUSPICIOUS? This microphone. It's COLD. In a heated room. OBVIOUSLY paranormal."

GHOST HECKLER: "It's -40 degrees outside. Everything is cold."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "Temperature can't explain EVERYTHING, apparition! That's lazy skepticism!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "I've been studying the layout of this club. The stage faces magnetic north. The exit signs spell 'TRAP' in Morse code if you squint. WAKE. UP."

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "And don't even get me started on the drink menu. 'Spirits'? Really? They're mocking us to our FACES!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "You know what? I'm not leaving. I'm going to perform until one of you ghosts admits what year the comedy industry became compromised!"

GHOST HECKLER: "Fine. 1842. Vaudeville was an inside job. Can you leave now?"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "I KNEW IT! Wait, are you being sarcastic? I can't tell with ectoplasm. This is why I need the whiteboard!"

CONSPIRATORIAL MAN: "Thank you, you've been a complicit audience! Remember: question everything, trust no one, and always check if your comedy club is built on cursed land! Good night!"
