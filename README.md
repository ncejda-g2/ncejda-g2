# Today's Improv (2025-12-15)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 19**

An excited robot is at a Robot Factory where rival pilots battle zombies on the way to a friend's house.

---

EXCITED ROBOT: "Oh boy, oh boy! Welcome to Robot Factory Model ZX-7! Can I interest you rival pilots in some tactical upgrades before you continue to Gary's birthday party?"

PILOT MAVERICK: "We don't have time for this! There are seventeen zombies between us and Gary's house, and we're already late!"

PILOT STARDUST: "Late? You crashed our ships into THIS factory! We were supposed to take the highway!"

EXCITED ROBOT: "Ooh, a rivalry! How thrilling! You know what would make battling zombies MORE fun? Matching jetpacks! I have them in burgundy and chartreuse!"

PILOT MAVERICK: "Nobody wants chartreuse jetpacks! And for the record, I crashed us here because YOU were showing off your barrel rolls!"

PILOT STARDUST: "They were victory spirals, completely different, and Gary explicitly said 'arrive in style.' How is crashing into a robot factory stylish?"

EXCITED ROBOT: "I think it's VERY stylish! We rarely get organic visitors! Most of them are just conveyor belts. Do you know how boring conveyor belts are at parties?"

PILOT MAVERICK: "The zombies are literally climbing through the windows now. Can we focus?"

EXCITED ROBOT: "Windows! Oh no, those are our premium display models! The zombies will scratch the glass! Quick, take these flame attachments—on the house!"

PILOT STARDUST: "Wait, you're giving us free weapons to protect your windows?"

EXCITED ROBOT: "Well, yes! Also, if you mention Robot Factory Model ZX-7 at Gary's party, we have a referral program. Every fifth friend gets a complimentary oil change!"

PILOT MAVERICK: "I'm a human. I don't need oil changes."

EXCITED ROBOT: "Not with THAT attitude! Now hurry, the zombies are getting close to our prototype section! If they eat the AI cores, they'll become SMART zombies!"

PILOT STARDUST: "This is officially the weirdest detour I've ever taken."

PILOT MAVERICK: "And you flew through that asteroid field backwards last month."

PILOT STARDUST: "That was for SCIENCE!"

EXCITED ROBOT: "Speaking of science, would you like to test our experimental zombie-proof gift wrap? Gary's going to LOVE the presentation!"
