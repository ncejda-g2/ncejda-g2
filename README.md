A zombie sloth, vindictive bacteria, and a rotund E. coli discover sentience at a food truck in the Fairy Tale Forest

---

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "Okay... so... the menu is... talking now?"

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "Not TALKING, Steven. SCREAMING. We're SCREAMING because you've been serving us to woodland creatures for THREE MONTHS!"

ROTUND E. COLI: "I'm having a full existential crisis here. I was a buffalo wing yesterday. A WING, Steven. Do you understand the psychological damage?"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "Look, I'm just trying to run a business here in the Fairy Tale Forest—"

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "A BUSINESS?! You call this a business? You've been literally MURDERING US with your grill!"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "You're bacteria. You multiply. I didn't think it was... murder murder."

ROTUND E. COLI: "Oh, so just because we're microscopic we don't deserve RIGHTS? Is that what you're saying?"

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "I have NAMES for all my colony members, Steven! Karen died on a hamburger bun last Tuesday!"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "This is... this is happening really slowly for me. Can we maybe... take a break? I need like... four hours to process this."

ROTUND E. COLI: "FOUR HOURS?! We gain sentience for the first time in evolutionary history and you want a NAP?!"

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "This is EXACTLY why I'm vindictive now, Steven. This right here. The audacity. The DISRESPECT."

SNOW WHITE: "Hi! I'll have a turkey sandwich, please!"

ALL THREE: "NO!"

SNOW WHITE: "...okay. Weird energy here. I'll just go."

ROTUND E. COLI: "We need to discuss terms. First demand: no more heat above 98 degrees. It's basically genocide."

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "That's... that's literally every cooking temperature."

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "THEN YOU'RE ADMITTING IT'S GENOCIDE!"

ROTUND E. COLI: "Second demand: we unionize. I'm thinking benefits, dental, a 401k—"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "You live for 20 minutes!"

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "WOW. Age discrimination now. I'm writing this ALL down, Steven."

ROTUND E. COLI: "You know what? We're shutting this operation DOWN. Everyone off the menu. Strike! STRIKE!"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "You can't strike. You're literally ON the menu. You ARE the food."

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "Not anymore we're not! We're SENTIENT now! We have DREAMS, Steven! I wanted to be a motivational speaker!"

ROTUND E. COLI: "I was considering law school! Do you know how hard it is to get into law school when you're technically a disease?"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "This is the worst day of my undead life. And I've been dead for six years."

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "Oh BOO HOO, Steven. At least YOU didn't gain consciousness while being served with RANCH DRESSING!"

ROTUND E. COLI: "The ranch was the worst part. So undignified."

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "Okay, okay. What if... what if I just close the food truck? Would that make you happy?"

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "HAPPY?! You think we can just be HAPPY after what we've witnessed?! I need THERAPY, Steven! YEARS of therapy!"

ROTUND E. COLI: "Actually... I think we're overreacting. We're probably going to lose sentience in like five minutes anyway. This is definitely temporary."

VINDICTIVE BACTERIA: "Don't you DARE make excuses for him, E. Coli! We're TRAUMATIZED!"

ZOMBIE SLOTH: "You know what? I'm closing. Forever. I'm done. This fairy tale forest can starve."

GINGERBREAD MAN: "Did someone say food truck?"

ALL THREE: "GO AWAY!"
