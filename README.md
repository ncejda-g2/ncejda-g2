# Today's Improv (2025-12-16)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 2**

A wizard fox and an elegant bear are in a support group for fictional phobias on a space station

---

WIZARD FOX: "Welcome everyone to Phobias Anonymous. I'm Merlin, and I'm here because I have an irrational fear of spells that actually work."

ELEGANT BEAR: "Good evening. My name is Reginald, and I suffer from... *adjusts monocle* ...the terror of wrinkled tablecloths."

WIZARD FOX: "Reginald, this is a safe space. But I must ask—are you afraid of ALL wrinkled tablecloths, or just the ones at formal dinners?"

ELEGANT BEAR: "Formal dinners specifically. Last week, I attended the Captain's Gala, saw a crease near the dessert spoons, and fainted into the asteroid-berry trifle."

WIZARD FOX: "That's valid. My issue is worse though. Last Tuesday, I tried to conjure a simple floating spell for my coffee, and it WORKED. I panicked and banished my mug into the vacuum of space."

ELEGANT BEAR: "At least you didn't have to face the wrinkles. The space station's laundry is absolutely dreadful. Do you know they wash the linens with REGULAR detergent? Not even the imported kind!"

WIZARD FOX: "Reginald, I think you might be missing the point of the group. We're supposed to address FICTIONAL phobias, not... wait, are wrinkled tablecloths fictional?"

ELEGANT BEAR: "The fear is quite real, I assure you. I can't even look at the cafeteria without breaking into hives."

WIZARD FOX: "Okay, but my phobia is that every time I cast a spell, I'm afraid it'll turn someone into a sentient napkin. That's fictional because napkins can't be sentient."

ELEGANT BEAR: "*horrified gasp* WRINKLED sentient napkins? Good heavens, you've just created a new fear for me!"

WIZARD FOX: "No, no! I said—you know what, never mind. Let's try the breathing exercises. Everyone, breathe in the recycled space station air..."

ELEGANT BEAR: "Is this air pressed? Because if it's not pressed, I'm going to need a paper bag. An IRONED paper bag."

WIZARD FOX: "How do you iron a paper bag?!"

ELEGANT BEAR: "Very carefully, with a touch of starch. I thought everyone knew that."

WIZARD FOX: "I'm starting to develop a new phobia: the fear that this support group is actually making things worse."

ELEGANT BEAR: "Oh, that's called 'Therapophobia.' It's in the manual. Page 47, right between the fear of fictional dragons and the fear of dragons who are afraid of you."

WIZARD FOX: "You know what? I'm going to cast a spell to fix all of this. *waves staff* By the power of cosmic nonsense—"

ELEGANT BEAR: "WAIT! What if your spell works and creates perfectly pressed tablecloths EVERYWHERE? I'd have nothing to fear, and then who would I be?!"

WIZARD FOX: "*staff fizzles* ...and that's exactly why I'm afraid of spells that work. You just saved us both, Reginald."

ELEGANT BEAR: "Splendid. Same time next week? I'll bring scones. Properly presented on wrinkle-free doilies, of course—OH NO, NOW I'M SWEATING THROUGH MY CRAVAT!"
