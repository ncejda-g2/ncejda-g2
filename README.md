# Today's Improv (2025-12-26)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 13**

A samurai beetle, an unhinged banshee, and a pirate witch handle a retirement party where the retiree refuses to leave and barricades themselves in the office in the Fairy Tale Forest

SAMURAI BEETLE: "Honor demands we respect Gerald's retirement. He has served this enchanted HR department for forty years."

PIRATE WITCH: "Aye, and honor also demands he GET OUT. We rented the mushroom pavilion for three hours and the cake's meltin'!"

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "GEEERAAALD! OPEN THE DOOOOOR! I MADE A SPEECHES!"

GERALD THE GNOME: "*from behind barricaded door* I'M NOT LEAVING! You can't make me retire! I still have so much filing to do!"

SAMURAI BEETLE: "*taps tiny sword on door* Gerald-san, your retirement is inevitable. Like cherry blossoms, all careers must fall."

PIRATE WITCH: "Poetic. I was gonna say 'like walkin' the plank,' but sure."

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "*wailing* We got you a GOLD WATCH! It's VERY SHINY! I'm EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THIS PARTY!"

GERALD THE GNOME: "I don't want a gold watch! I want my DESK! My STAPLER! My color-coded filing system!"

SAMURAI BEETLE: "I must negotiate with honor. *clears throat* Gerald-san, what would make you leave peacefully?"

GERALD THE GNOME: "I want my job back! Retirement is a CONSPIRACY invented by Big Calendar!"

PIRATE WITCH: "Big Calendar? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I once believed in a fountain of youth made of grog."

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "WAIT! I have an idea! *screeches at maximum volume*"

SAMURAI BEETLE: "Please stop doing that. You're disrupting my inner peace."

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "Gerald! What if we make you... RETIRED CONSULTANT?!"

GERALD THE GNOME: "*silence* ...Keep talking."

PIRATE WITCH: "Oh, for barnacle's sake. We're not actually—"

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "You can come in WHENEVER YOU WANT! But you don't HAVE to! It's PERFECT!"

GERALD THE GNOME: "Will I still have my desk?"

SAMURAI BEETLE: "A compromise. The way of the warrior approves. You may visit your desk on Tuesdays."

GERALD THE GNOME: "And Thursdays?"

PIRATE WITCH: "Don't push it, mate."

GERALD THE GNOME: "*sound of furniture moving* ...Fine. But I'm taking my stapler."

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "*opens door* YAAAAY! GROUP HUG! *immediately regrets this as Gerald hugs too tight*"

SAMURAI BEETLE: "Victory through diplomacy. Now, where is this melting cake?"

PIRATE WITCH: "The frosting's become sentient. It's demanding workers' rights."

GERALD THE GNOME: "Oh! I can file the paperwork for that! See? You DO need me!"

UNHINGED BANSHEE: "...What have we DONE?"
