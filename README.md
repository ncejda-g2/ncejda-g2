# Today's Improv (2026-02-16)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 65**

A petulant man must teach portion control to a disillusioned ant and an oblivious ant who are his past selves from different timelines in the Arctic

---

PETULANT MAN: "Alright, listen up, past mes. I've traveled through multiple timelines to stage this intervention in the Arctic because you RUINED my life with your eating habits!"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "Oh great, another lecture. I've heard it all before. Life is meaningless, hot dogs are fleeting, what's the point?"

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "Wait, you're me? From the future? Cool! Do I get bigger? I feel like I should get bigger."

PETULANT MAN: "NO! That's the PROBLEM! In Timeline A, you became an ant with no self-control. In Timeline B, you became a DEPRESSED ant with no self-control. And I became... THIS!" *gestures angrily at himself*

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "You look fine to me. Actually, no, you look awful. But everything looks awful when you've lost hope."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "Why are we in the Arctic? Is there food here? I'm kinda hungry."

PETULANT MAN: "SEE?! That's EXACTLY the attitude I'm talking about! 'I'm kinda hungry' became 'I'm entering my 47th hot dog eating contest this month!'"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "Hot dogs don't even taste good. Nothing tastes good anymore. I remember when I thought winning mattered. Now I realize we're all just ants shoving processed meat into the void."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "I LOVE hot dogs! Wait, are we having hot dogs now? Is that why we're here?"

PETULANT MAN: "NO! We're here because the cold slows down your metabolism and maybe—MAYBE—you'll listen to reason! Do you know what happened after you won the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest seventeen times in a row?"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "We became empty inside?"

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "We got a trophy?"

PETULANT MAN: "We got BANNED! And then we got so depressed we ate an entire industrial freezer full of hot dogs and got trapped in Antarctica with a penguin colony that STILL makes fun of me!"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "That tracks. Everything I've ever accomplished has been meaningless. Remember when we thought eating 73 hot dogs in 10 minutes would make us happy?"

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "That DOES sound happy! Was it happy? I bet it was happy!"

PETULANT MAN: "It was NOT! Our stomach exploded! Metaphorically! But also kind of literally!"

PENGUIN: *waddles by* "Hey, it's Hot Dog Gary! Still banned from every buffet in the Northern Hemisphere?"

PETULANT MAN: "GO AWAY, PENGUIN!"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "See? Even flightless birds mock us. This is what we've become."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "That penguin seems nice. Do penguins eat hot dogs?"

PETULANT MAN: "This is IMPOSSIBLE! I'm trying to teach you about portion control! One hot dog is a MEAL! Two hot dogs is EXCESSIVE! Seventy-three hot dogs is a CRY FOR HELP!"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "But what does it matter? In Timeline C, we're probably a mushroom. In Timeline D, we never existed. Portion control is just another construct to distract us from the absurdity of existence."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "Ooh, I like mushrooms! Do you think mushrooms can eat hot dogs?"

PETULANT MAN: "WHY DID I THINK THIS WOULD WORK?!"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "Because deep down, you still have hope. That's your problem. You haven't fully accepted the futility yet."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "I'm confused. Are we eating or not eating? Because I packed snacks and I don't want them to get cold. Well, colder. We're already in the Arctic."

PETULANT MAN: "You know what? FINE. Let me try a different approach. What if I told you that eating in moderation means you can enjoy FLAVOR again? That food becomes SPECIAL instead of just... fuel for your shame spiral?"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "I don't believe in special anymore."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "I believe in everything! Especially hot dogs!"

PETULANT MAN: "I CAME BACK THROUGH TIME AND SPACE TO FIX THIS!"

DISILLUSIONED ANT: "Maybe the real portion control was the existential dread we collected along the way."

OBLIVIOUS ANT: "So... should I eat my snacks now or...?"

PETULANT MAN: "You're both IMPOSSIBLE! I'm going back to my timeline where at least the penguins respect me!"

PENGUIN: *from a distance* "No we don't!"
