An egomaniacal fox motivational speaker attempts to convince a pessimistic weatherman that clouds have feelings in an office

---

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Thank you for having me here. Though honestly, I should be thanking YOU for the privilege of experiencing MY presence."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Now, Steve—can I call you Steve? I'm calling you Steve—Steve, I've reviewed your weather reports for the past six months, and frankly, they're depressing."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Forty percent chance of rain. Partly cloudy. Overcast. Where's the PASSION, Steve? Where's the EMPATHY?"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "You see, what you don't understand—and I do, because I'm a visionary—is that clouds have FEELINGS."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Yes, feelings! Each cumulus, each nimbus, each cirrus is a living, breathing emotional entity crying out for acknowledgment!"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "And before you say anything, let me stop you right there with my impeccable fox intuition. You're thinking: 'This fox is brilliant AND handsome.' Correct on both counts."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "But you're also thinking: 'Clouds are water vapor.' WRONG. Water vapor with EMOTIONS, Steve."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Just yesterday, I looked up at a particularly moody cumulonimbus, and you know what it told me? It said, 'Mr. Fox, why does Steve keep calling me threatening?'"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "That's RIGHT. You've been emotionally devastating our atmospheric friends with your callous meteorological assessments!"

WEATHERMAN STEVE: "Are you... are you having a stroke?"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "I'm having a BREAKTHROUGH, Steve! Something you've clearly never experienced given your pedestrian forecast vocabulary!"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "From now on, you need to approach your forecasts with sensitivity. Not 'chance of thunderstorms'—no! It's 'possibility of emotional cloud release.'"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Not 'fog advisory.' Try 'low-altitude clouds seeking connection and visibility.'"

WEATHERMAN STEVE: "I have a degree in atmospheric science."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "And I have a GIFT, Steve. Given to me by the universe because it recognized my superiority. Which degree seems more impressive?"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Look at you, sitting there with your barometric pressure charts and your Doppler radar, completely oblivious to the EMOTIONAL pressure systems!"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "You know what? I'm going to do something generous right now. Something only someone of my caliber would even think to do."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "I'm going to give you a FREE PASS to one of my seminars: 'Cloudfulness: A Meteorological Awakening.' Normally $800, but for you? Still $800. Because you NEED it."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "We'll do trust exercises with stratus clouds. Meditation with fog banks. By the end, you'll be weeping openly at the sight of a simple rain shower."

WEATHERMAN STEVE: "Security is on their way."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Of course they are! Because greatness always makes people uncomfortable! Do you think Gandhi wasn't escorted out of offices?"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Mark my words, Steve. One day you'll look up at a sobbing nimbostratus and think, 'That fox was right. That magnificent, luminous fox was RIGHT.'"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "And on that day, you'll try to book a session with me, and you know what I'll say?"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "I'll say, 'My rate has tripled, and there's a six-month waiting list, but yes, I'll still help you because I'm THAT magnanimous.'"

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a TED Talk to prepare about the inner life of precipitation. Keep my card. You'll need it."

EGOMANIACAL FOX: "And Steve? That cumulus outside your window? It's judging you. Just thought you should know."
