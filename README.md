### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** Vampire Moose lands on an alien planet and encounters a tentacled alien salesman. "Welcome, traveler! Try our NEW Planet-6 Atmospheric Breathing System—4K oxygen molecules, radium backlight for your lungs, and a front nostril centered for eye contact during respiration!"

**Panel 2:** Vampire Moose examines the product specs: "Burns clean methane... includes applicator... GPS transmitter in every breath... can survive up to 30 minutes OUT of atmosphere?" The alien nods enthusiastically: "Yes! Normally you'd need to be IN atmosphere to breathe, but this baby breaks ALL the rules! Plus, it comes pre-seasoned!"

**Panel 3:** Vampire Moose takes one breath and immediately floats off the ground, antlers glowing neon green, while his fangs turn into kazoos. The alien cheerfully waves: "Oh right, forgot to mention—it auto-administers seasonal fun vaccines! Side effects include involuntary levitation and musical dental work!" Vampire Moose, drifting into space while his teeth play the Macarena: "THIS IS WHY I NEVER UPDATE MY LUNGS."
