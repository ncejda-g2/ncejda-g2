### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** A grumpy moose programmer announces at the forest tech meetup that he's releasing his code as "open source." A crying hedgehog immediately bursts into tears of joy, sobbing "Finally! I've been trying to understand your spaghetti code for MONTHS!"

**Panel 2:** The grumpy moose grumpily watches as the crying hedgehog (still weeping) submits 47 pull requests in one night, fixing bugs, adding documentation, and reorganizing everything. "Stop crying on my keyboard!" the moose grumbles. The hedgehog sobs harder: "I can't help it—your variable names are just SO BEAUTIFUL now!"

**Panel 3:** One week later, the crying hedgehog has completely rewritten the entire codebase, gained 10,000 GitHub stars, and started a tech company around it. The grumpy moose sits in the corner, grumpily holding a "1% Original Author" coffee mug. The hedgehog, tears streaming down, whispers: "We're dressing up as Big Oil thugs to surprise Ralph Nader next week—you IN?" The moose is somehow even grumpier.
