**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 10**

A gregarious E. coli and a vampire bear navigate a motivational seminar for time-loop victims in the desert

---

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "*bouncing excitedly under a microscope projection* Good morning, everyone! Welcome to 'Breaking the Loop: Your Best Timeline Starts NOW!' I'm so pumped to be here in the desert with you all!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "*slumped in folding chair, looking exhausted* This is my 847th time hearing this speech. You always say 'pumped.'"

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "Wow! Such detailed record-keeping! That's the kind of positive engagement I love to see!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "It's not engagement. It's despair with documentation."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "Let's start with an icebreaker! Everyone share one thing you're grateful for!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "I'm grateful this desert sun will eventually kill me. Oh wait, no it won't. I've tried 600 times."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "What an opportunity to build resilience! Now, who here believes they can break their time loop?"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "We can't. Steve tried last Tuesday. He's tried every Tuesday for 3,000 Tuesdays."

FRIENDLY ARMADILLO: "*rolling in from backstage* Sorry I'm late! Got stuck in a pothole again. Same pothole as always."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "No worries! There are no mistakes, only learning opportunities! Now, let's talk about the five steps to temporal freedom!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "Step one: Realize you're in a loop. Step two: Try everything. Step three: Fail. Step four: Existential dread. Step five: This seminar."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "That's... actually not the list I had, but I love your participation! You're already halfway to breakthrough!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "I've had 847 breakthroughs. They all loop back to this moment."

FRIENDLY ARMADILLO: "He's not wrong. Last loop, I finally made it out of that pothole, but then time reset and I was back in it."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "But what if THIS time is different? What if your breakthrough is happening RIGHT NOW?"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "You know what's happening right now? The same thing that happened the last 846 times. In 30 seconds, you're going to do a trust fall exercise."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "That's... how did you... okay, yes, I was! But that's just good seminar design!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "And I'm going to say I can't participate because I'm immortal and trust issues are meaningless when you've lived 400 years in the same Thursday."

FRIENDLY ARMADILLO: "Can we do the trust fall anyway? I never get to catch anyone because of my shell configuration."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "You know what? I see what's happening here. You're all stuck because you've lost hope! But I'm a microscopic bacterium leading a desert seminar, and I still believe in miracles!"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "That's because you're freshly divided from yesterday's E. coli. You don't remember the previous loops."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "*pause* ...wait, what?"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "You restart every 24 hours. You're the only one here who gets a clean slate. That's why you're always so... gregarious."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "I... I have so many questions."

FRIENDLY ARMADILLO: "We keep coming because your optimism is the only thing that changes. Everything else is identical, but your joy is genuine every single time."

VAMPIRE BEAR: "It's horrifying and beautiful. Like a sunset you've seen 10,000 times but still somehow stings your undead eyes."

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "*quietly* So... the trust fall?"

VAMPIRE BEAR: "*stands up slowly* Yeah. Let's do the trust fall."

FRIENDLY ARMADILLO: "I'll try to catch you with my inadequate shell!"

GREGARIOUS E. COLI: "This is either the saddest or most beautiful thing I'll never remember."

VAMPIRE BEAR: "Same thing out here. Same thing everywhere."
