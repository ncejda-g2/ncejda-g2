# Today's Improv (2026-02-08)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 57**

A hungry E. coli and a gourmet troll are flight attendants caught in a lab accident in Dreamland

---

HUNGRY E. COLI: "Alright passengers, we're experiencing some turbulence due to... *checks clipboard* ...a catastrophic lab accident that's merged our plane with a molecular biology experiment?"

GOURMET TROLL: "The captain has turned on the 'fasten your peptide bonds' sign. Please remain seated while we figure out why half the cabin is now a petri dish."

HUNGRY E. COLI: "Can I get anyone a beverage? We have water, juice, and... why is there agar gel in the drink cart?"

GOURMET TROLL: "Because we're flying through DREAMLAND, darling. The agar is locally sourced, artisanal, with hints of lysogeny broth."

HUNGRY E. COLI: "I don't care if it's artisanal, I'm STARVING. Can I eat the agar?"

GOURMET TROLL: "Absolutely not! That agar is for the passengers! It pairs beautifully with the existential terror of dimensional instability."

MUTATED PASSENGER: *sprouting tentacles* "Excuse me, I ordered the vegetarian meal!"

HUNGRY E. COLI: "Sir, you ARE the vegetarian meal now. You've been genetically fused with a Brussels sprout."

GOURMET TROLL: "A TRAGIC waste of good produce. Brussels sprouts should be roasted with balsamic glaze, not merged with accounting executives!"

HUNGRY E. COLI: "Focus! The lab accident is spreading! Row 12 just became a centrifuge!"

GOURMET TROLL: "And Row 15 is now a BUFFET of cellular mitosis! Look at those daughter cells multiplying—so fresh, so organic!"

HUNGRY E. COLI: "You want to EAT the passengers?!"

GOURMET TROLL: "I want to APPRECIATE them! There's a difference! Note the membrane integrity, the protein folding..."

HUNGRY E. COLI: "The emergency exits are located—OH NO, the emergency exits have become microscope slides!"

GOURMET TROLL: "In case of decompression, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead compartment. Or possibly spores. Hard to tell in Dreamland."

CAPTAIN'S VOICE: "Attention crew: We've stabilized at 30,000 feet, but we're now technically flying through the fourth dimension AND someone's thesis experiment."

HUNGRY E. COLI: "Great, just GREAT. How do I explain this to corporate?"

GOURMET TROLL: "On the bright side, the in-flight meal has achieved consciousness and is critiquing our service."

SENTIENT MEAL: "Two stars. The ambiance is chaotic, the molecular structure is inconsistent."

HUNGRY E. COLI: "That's IT. I'm eating the meal."

GOURMET TROLL: "You can't eat a meal that can RATE you on Yelp!"

HUNGRY E. COLI: "Watch me!"

SENTIENT MEAL: "ONE STAR!"
