### Characters

*You're probably thinking, 'has it been a decade?'  It's been over thirteen years, buddy.*

### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** A silly penguin waddles into the Antarctic Research Lab wearing a hard hat and announces: "According to my calculations, the velociraptors went extinct exactly 65 million years ago today!" A friendly platypus looks up from his clipboard and cheerfully says, "Actually buddy, that was 65 million AND thirteen years ago."

**Panel 2:** The silly penguin freezes mid-waddle, eyes widening. A friendly pangolin rolls up (literally, in a ball) and unrolls to add helpfully: "Yeah, we've been keeping track. There's a countdown clock in the break room and everything." The platypus nods enthusiastically: "We throw a party every million years!"

**Panel 3:** Cut to all three wearing party hats at a desk covered in charts labeled "RAPTOR-FREE DAYS: 65,000,013 YEARS." The silly penguin is sobbing into a cake that says "CONGRATS ON NOT BEING EATEN." Suddenly, a velociraptor's claw taps the penguin's shoulder from off-panel. The platypus whispers: "Should we reset the counter?" The pangolin is already rolling away at top speed.
