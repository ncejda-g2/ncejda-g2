### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** An excited capybara stands at a jungle crossroads holding a handmade sign: "SPLASH IN THE RIVER IF YOU UNDERSTAND LOGIC!" A toucan flies overhead and asks, "Why are you doing this?" The capybara beams: "If they splash, it proves they get it! And if they don't splash, it also proves they get it because splashing would be a conditional statement!"

**Panel 2:** A confused sloth slowly approaches the river while the capybara watches eagerly. The sloth thinks for ten minutes, then carefully dips one toe in. The capybara squeals: "PARTIAL SPLASH! That's either a sign of incomplete understanding OR you're acknowledging the proposition is conditionally true but contextually ambiguous!" The sloth mutters: "I just wanted to cool off..."

**Panel 3:** Suddenly, an elephant cannon-balls into the river, creating a massive splash that soaks everyone. The capybara, dripping wet and grinning maniacally, shouts: "WAIT—did you splash because you love logic, or because you're an elephant who loves water?! THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!" The elephant surfaces: "I splashed because your sign said 'SPLASH IN THE RIVER.'" The capybara's mind explodes: "LITERAL INTERPRETATION! THE PUREST FORM OF LOGIC!"
