# Today's Improv (2026-01-28)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 46**

An elegant banshee and a brave squirrel pursue true passions instead of collecting tolls in Dreamland

---

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "So, tell me, how long have you been working this bridge?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "Thirty-seven years. Every single day. 'Pay the toll or face the wrath.' That's my line."

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "And how does that make you feel?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "Powerful. Respected. Feared. Also, my back hurts and I haven't seen my family since 1989."

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "I sense you're not living your truth. What do you REALLY want to do?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "I... I want to be a pastry chef."

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "I'm sorry, what?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "Croissants. Eclairs. Delicate little macarons. I dream about them every night."

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "You're a bridge troll who wants to make French pastries."

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "I'm a SQUIRREL who's been PRETENDING to be a bridge troll! I don't even know why I took this job!"

ELEGANT ANT: *scurrying across the bridge* "Excuse me, is there a toll?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "FIVE ACORNS OR YOU SHALL NOT—"

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "Stop. What would pastry-chef you say?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: *clears throat* "Would you like to sample our complimentary pain au chocolat?"

ELEGANT ANT: "Oh my goodness, yes! This is the most elegant bridge experience I've ever had!"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "Really?"

ELEGANT ANT: "Absolutely! You know what? I'm an investor. Have you considered franchising this concept? 'Gourmet Toll Bridges'?"

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "See? You're already integrating your passions!"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "But what about being brave and intimidating? That's who I am!"

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "It takes MORE bravery to make a perfect soufflé than to yell at travelers. Do you know how temperamental egg whites are?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "They're... temperamental?"

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "EXTREMELY. One wrong move and your meringue collapses. That's true danger."

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "I never thought about it that way."

ELEGANT ANT: "I'm writing you a check right now. Ten thousand acorns for 30% equity."

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "Wait, this is Dreamland. None of this is real, is it?"

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "Does that make your dreams any less valid?"

BRAVE SQUIRREL: "I... I need to wake up and enroll in culinary school."

ELEGANT BANSHEE: "That's the spirit! And remember—every toll you collected was just practice for measuring ingredients with precision."

BRAVE SQUIRREL: *waking up* "HONEY! I'M QUITTING THE BRIDGE!"
