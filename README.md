# Today's Improv (2026-01-16)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 34**

A rockstar woman, an unhinged alien, and a nervous angel are flight attendants caught in a lab accident in the Dinosaur Jungle

---

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "Okay, so the plane crashed into a secret lab, we're in a dinosaur jungle, and my hair is now sentient. Rock and roll."

NERVOUS ANGEL: "Oh no, oh no, this is bad! My wings are glowing purple! That's NOT a normal angel color!"

UNHINGED ALIEN: "YOU THINK THAT'S BAD? I've got seven new eyeballs and they're all judging me differently!"

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "At least you can still walk. My legs merged into a single tail. I'm a flight attendant mermaid."

SENTIENT HAIR: "Hello. I am your hair now. We need to talk about your conditioner choices."

NERVOUS ANGEL: "THE HAIR IS TALKING! Why is the hair talking?!"

UNHINGED ALIEN: "Because we crashed into a MUTAGENIC BIOLAB, Steve! Wait, why did I call you Steve?"

NERVOUS ANGEL: "My name's not—oh wow, I think I can read minds now. You're thinking about eating the dinosaurs."

UNHINGED ALIEN: "They look DELICIOUS! All scaly and prehistoric!"

VELOCIRAPTOR: "Excuse me, we're standing right here."

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "Great, the dinosaurs talk too. Listen, dino-dude, we need to find the lab antidote before this gets worse."

SENTIENT HAIR: "Actually, I'm quite enjoying existence. Can we not?"

NERVOUS ANGEL: "My left wing just turned into a question mark! How is that even POSSIBLE?!"

UNHINGED ALIEN: "I'm growing a third arm and it's giving me a thumbs up. I think it's being supportive?"

VELOCIRAPTOR: "The lab's that way, but fair warning: the head scientist is now a sentient clipboard."

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "Of course he is. NOTHING makes sense anymore."

CLIPBOARD SCIENTIST: "Hello! I'm legally required to inform you that all mutations are permanent after 30 minutes!"

NERVOUS ANGEL: "HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?!"

UNHINGED ALIEN: "Who cares?! I've never felt MORE alive! I'm thinking about starting a band with my eyeballs!"

SENTIENT HAIR: "I'll be your manager. I'm very well-connected."

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "No. Absolutely not. We're getting the antidote, reversing this, and filing the WORST incident report in aviation history."

VELOCIRAPTOR: "Can I get your autograph first? I'm a huge fan of your band."

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "...You know my band?"

VELOCIRAPTOR: "Yeah! 'Thunder Lizard Blues'? Classic."

UNHINGED ALIEN: "WAIT. The dinosaurs have been listening to rock music this whole time?!"

NERVOUS ANGEL: "My question mark wing just turned into an exclamation point! I think it's reacting to my emotions!"

CLIPBOARD SCIENTIST: "Side effects may include: spontaneous punctuation, musical dinosaurs, and philosophical hair."

SENTIENT HAIR: "I prefer 'existentially curious hair,' thank you."

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "Fine. NEW plan. We grab the antidote, turn everything back to normal, and we NEVER speak of this again."

UNHINGED ALIEN: "But what about my eyeball band?!"

ROCKSTAR WOMAN: "ESPECIALLY not about the eyeball band."
