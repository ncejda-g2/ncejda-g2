A dehydrated venus fly trap receives a mysterious phone call deep in the jungle about their top-secret invention

---

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "Day forty-seven in the jungle. No rain. No flies. One moth wandered close last Tuesday and I — I don't want to talk about what happened. The point is I've been *working*. On my invention."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: *gestures proudly at a pile of vines and coconut shells* "The Moisture-Matic 3000. Patent pending. Obviously not pending with any official patent office because I am a plant in the jungle, but *spiritually* pending."

*A phone rings somewhere in the undergrowth*

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "...That's odd. I don't have a phone. I don't have hands. I am a plant."

*It rings again*

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "FINE." *opens and closes jaw to answer* "...Hello?"

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "Is this the inventor?"

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "That depends entirely on who's asking and whether you are a fly."

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "We know about the Moisture-Matic."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: *nearly wilting* "How do you know that name. That is a classified name. I told no one that name. I announced it to a lizard once but he ran away immediately."

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "We've been watching you."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "Watching me sit here, parched, slowly dying in a jungle which is somehow — *somehow* — not humid enough for me specifically? You watched *that* and did not intervene?"

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "We want to fund your invention. Forty million dollars. In exchange for exclusive rights."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "I'd like forty million drops of water, actually. And also please explain how you called a venus fly trap on a telephone. I have no ears. I have no phone. I have a mouth and it is for catching things, not chatting."

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "The universe works in mysterious ways."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "That is not an answer! That is a bumper sticker!"

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: *quietly, with great dignity* "I need you to know I snapped at a hummingbird this morning out of desperation. It was too fast. I missed completely. The hummingbird hovered there an extra second just to make sure I understood what had happened."

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "The Moisture-Matic could change everything."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "It could change *my* everything! I built it out of vines and ambition! The coconut shell is load-bearing!"

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "We need a demonstration. Tomorrow. In Monaco."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "Monaco. You want me — a plant. Rooted to the ground. No legs, no passport, no ability to move *whatsoever* — to be in Monaco by tomorrow."

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "We'll send a helicopter."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: *long pause* "...Are there flies in Monaco?"

MYSTERIOUS CALLER: "Undoubtedly."

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "Then I will figure out the rooting situation. I've solved harder problems." *glances at the Moisture-Matic* "I invented *that*."

*hangs up*

DEHYDRATED VENUS FLY TRAP: "Day forty-seven in the jungle. A stranger called. They know about my work. I may be going to Monaco." *pause* "I should probably invent legs first."
