A superstitious giraffe and a delusional chicken fight for an aging butler's inheritance in the clouds

---

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "According to Madam Gertrude's will, the inheritance goes to whoever can reach the highest point in the clouds. I've been training my whole life for this."

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "I'm already the CEO of three Fortune 500 companies. This inheritance is just a formality."

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "You work at a gas station."

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "That's my *side hustle*. Keeps me humble."

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "Wait—did you just step on a crack in this cloud? That's seven years bad luck!"

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "Clouds don't have cracks, they're made of water vapor."

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "EXACTLY! Which means you just stepped on LIQUID BAD LUCK!"

NARCISSISTIC NEWT: *emerging from a cloud puff* "Excuse me, I'm here for the reading of the will? I assume I'm the main beneficiary since I'm clearly the most attractive amphibian present."

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "Get in line, newt. I've already mentally spent this money on my yacht collection."

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "A newt?! On a Tuesday?! In CLOUDS?! Do you know what the omens say about this?"

NARCISSISTIC NEWT: "That I look fabulous in natural lighting?"

LAWYER PIGEON: *flies in with a briefcase* "Ahem. I'm here to read the last will and testament of Madam Gertrude the Butler. She has left her entire fortune to... whoever can explain what a butler actually does."

ALL THREE: *silence*

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "Easy. They... buttle things."

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "Is that even a verb? This feels like a trap. Should I throw salt over my shoulder?"

NARCISSISTIC NEWT: "Obviously they admire the master of the house's impeccable taste and good looks."

LAWYER PIGEON: "You're all wrong. Madam Gertrude was testing you. The real inheritance goes to whoever DOESN'T know—proving they're humble enough to deserve wealth."

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "I KNEW I didn't know! I'm a genius!"

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "Wait, if we're in the clouds and we don't know things... does that mean we're in limbo? Is this purgatory?!"

NARCISSISTIC NEWT: "If this is the afterlife, they really need to work on the decor. Where are the mirrors?"

LAWYER PIGEON: "Actually, I'm just messing with you. She left everything to her cat."

ALL THREE: "WHAT?!"

LAWYER PIGEON: "Yeah, Mr. Whiskers. He's been living in a penthouse in Paris this whole time. Madam Gertrude just wanted to see you all argue on a cloud. She thought it would be funny."

DELUSIONAL CHICKEN: "Joke's on her—I'm already planning my comeback tour."

SUPERSTITIOUS GIRAFFE: "I need to consult my dream journal about this."

NARCISSISTIC NEWT: "At least I looked stunning throughout this entire ordeal."
