# Today's Improv (2026-01-17)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 35**

A silly banshee, a manic ant, and a superstitious demon are Renaissance painters on an alien planet when they discover their masterpiece has become a meme

---

SILLY BANSHEE: "So I'm scrolling through the intergalactic internet, right? And our painting of 'The Last Supper on Planet Zorgon' has 47 million shares."

MANIC ANT: "THAT'S AMAZING! WE'RE FAMOUS! I knew three years of painting all those alien tentacles would pay off!"

SUPERSTITIOUS DEMON: "Wait, wait, wait. What are they SAYING about it? Did anyone knock on wood before sharing? This feels cursed."

SILLY BANSHEE: "Oh, they're saying stuff like 'When your WiFi disconnects during a Zoom call' and they edited in sunglasses on the alien Jesus."

MANIC ANT: "SUNGLASSES?! On our RENAISSANCE MASTERPIECE?! I'm vibrating with rage! Can ants vibrate? I'M FINDING OUT!"

SUPERSTITIOUS DEMON: "I TOLD you we shouldn't have painted on a Friday the 13th! Now it's been meme-ified! That's like... curse level 8!"

SILLY BANSHEE: "There's a whole subreddit called 'Alien Renaissance Fails' and we're the top post."

MANIC ANT: "Fails?! FAILS?! Do they know how hard it is to mix paint with six legs?! I had to use my FACE!"

ALIEN INFLUENCER: "Yo, can I get a selfie with you guys? You're like, totally viral right now. Hashtag blessed."

SUPERSTITIOUS DEMON: "See?! VIRAL! That's basically a HEX! We need to burn sage! Do they have sage on this planet?!"

SILLY BANSHEE: "Actually, according to this comment thread, we've started a whole new art movement called 'Accidentally Hilarious Renaissance.'"

MANIC ANT: "There's NOTHING accidental about my brushwork! Each tentacle took HOURS! I didn't sleep for WEEKS!"

SUPERSTITIOUS DEMON: "Okay, but hear me out... what if we LEAN INTO IT? Paint more 'cursed' stuff intentionally? I'm thinking: cats playing poker but they're all eldritch horrors?"

SILLY BANSHEE: "Wait, someone just offered us 10,000 space credits for a commissioned meme painting."

MANIC ANT: "TEN THOUSAND?! We spent three years on the original and got paid in alien berries!"

SILLY BANSHEE: "They want us to paint 'Galaxy Brain' but literally. Like, an actual brain floating in a galaxy."

SUPERSTITIOUS DEMON: "That's... actually kind of brilliant? And if we paint it under a full moon, maybe we can reverse the curse?"

MANIC ANT: "FORGET THE CURSE! I'm pivoting! We're meme artists now! Renaissance is DEAD! Long live DANK RENAISSANCE!"

SILLY BANSHEE: "Our art history professor is going to scream."

MANIC ANT: "Good! Let him scream! We're EVOLVING! This is our BLUE PERIOD except it's our MEME PERIOD!"

SUPERSTITIOUS DEMON: "Fine, but I'm wearing my lucky socks. All seven pairs of them."

ALIEN INFLUENCER: "This is going in my story. You guys are so authentic."
