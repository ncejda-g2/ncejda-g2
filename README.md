# Today's Improv (2025-12-22)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 9**

A gregarious fox, a rockstar capybara, and an upset lemur are job candidates with peculiar skills in the clouds

---

GREGARIOUS FOX: "*bouncing excitedly on a cloud* Hello everyone! Wow, what a great group! I'm so excited to be here! My special skill is that I can tell what people are thinking by smelling their socks!"

UPSET LEMUR: "*scowling, arms crossed* Of course that's your skill. Mine is way better. I can predict exactly when you're going to be disappointed. Speaking of which, it's happening right now."

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*strumming air guitar* Dudes, my skill is I can communicate exclusively through power ballads. *singing dramatically* IIIII'M HERE FOR THE JOOOOB!"

ANGEL INTERVIEWER: "*floating in, looking at clipboard* Thank you all for applying to be Cloud Quality Control Inspectors. Let's start with you, Fox. How would your... sock-smelling ability help us?"

GREGARIOUS FOX: "*sniffing enthusiastically* Oh, it's perfect! I can smell if clouds are happy! Like this one—*sniffs a cloud*—tastes like optimism and vanilla! Wait, that came out wrong. I mean it SMELLS like—"

UPSET LEMUR: "You're blowing it. I predicted this would happen approximately 40 seconds ago."

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*power slide across cloud* *singing* HEEEEE'S TRYING HIS BEEEEEST, BUT FAILING THE TEEEEST!"

ANGEL INTERVIEWER: "Right. Lemur, you predict disappointment. How is that useful for cloud inspection?"

UPSET LEMUR: "I can tell when clouds are about to fail quality standards before they do. Like that one over there. *points* It's going to turn gray and rain on someone's wedding in 6 minutes."

GREGARIOUS FOX: "But that's such a negative outlook! Have you considered the cloud might be going through something? Maybe it just needs a friend!"

UPSET LEMUR: "Your optimism is exhausting. I predict you'll say something cheerful in 3... 2... 1..."

GREGARIOUS FOX: "What a great prediction! You're so talented!"

UPSET LEMUR: "...I hate that I'm never wrong."

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*launching into epic guitar solo air-performance* *singing* WEEEEE COULD WORK TOGETHERRRRR, LIKE CLOUDS AND WHETHERRRRR!"

ANGEL INTERVIEWER: "Do you ONLY communicate through power ballads?"

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*singing softly* Yeeeeaaaah, it's been a problemmm since the accidennnnnt..."

GREGARIOUS FOX: "Ooh! What accident? Tell me everything! I love making new friends and learning their backstories!"

UPSET LEMUR: "Don't ask. I already know how this ends. Disappointingly."

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*singing emotionally* I WAS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING AT WOODSTOOOOCK, NOW I ONLY SPEAK IN ROCK AND ROLLLLLL!"

ANGEL INTERVIEWER: "*rubbing temples* Okay. Final question. How would you three work together as a team?"

GREGARIOUS FOX: "Amazing! I'd smell everyone's emotional clouds, spread joy, and organize team-building activities!"

UPSET LEMUR: "I'd predict all the ways Fox's activities would fail and save us time."

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*singing triumphantly* I'D PROVIDE THE SOUNDTRAAAAAACK!"

ANGEL INTERVIEWER: "You know what? You're all hired. The clouds have been too quiet lately. We need chaos."

UPSET LEMUR: "I predicted we'd get hired, but I'm still upset about it."

GREGARIOUS FOX: "*hugging everyone* GROUP HUG! This is the best day ever!"

ROCKSTAR CAPYBARA: "*singing* WEEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIEEEEENDS!"

UPSET LEMUR: "I give this job three days before something goes horribly wrong."

GREGARIOUS FOX: "What wonderful enthusiasm!"
