### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** A mischievous fox opens a certification booth at the mountain summit: "Get your OFFICIAL Mountain Climbing Certificate here! Only $50!" A hiker asks, "How do I know YOUR certificates are legitimate?" The fox grins and pulls out a laminated card: "Because I have a Certificate of Certificate Authority!"

**Panel 2:** The hiker squints at it: "Wait... who certified YOUR Certificate of Certificate Authority?" The fox, now sweating, rummages through a filing cabinet and produces another certificate: "My Certificate of Certificate Authority Authority, obviously!" The hiker crosses their arms: "And who certified THAT one?"

**Panel 3:** Three hours later, the mountain summit is buried under an avalanche of certificates, each certifying the previous one. The fox, standing on top of a 40-foot pile of paperwork, triumphantly holds up a hand-drawn crayon certificate that says "I'm Good At Stuff - signed, Me." The hiker, half-buried, shouts: "YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S THE MOST HONEST ONE YET, I'LL TAKE IT."
