# Today's Improv (2026-02-23)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 72**

A jittery pangolin inventor and a conspiratorial owl share a baffling phone call deep in the jungle, where a humble leaf blower may or may not be the only thing holding the entire rainforest canopy together

---

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "H-hello?! Who's there?! The sparks are completely normal, whatever you heard is a lie!"

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "Is this the inventor? The one who built... the device?"

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "I've built seventeen devices this week alone, you'll have to narrow it down—"

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "The one that HUMS. At exactly 3:47 AM. Every. Single. Night."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "...I call it the Jungle-Tron 9000. It's a leaf blower."

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "It is NOT simply a leaf blower. We've been watching it."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "Who is 'we'?!"

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "I'm not at liberty to say. But I will tell you we are organized. We meet Tuesdays. Attendance is mandatory."

NERDY CHICKEN: *wandering in from behind a whiteboard* "Did someone call? I brought the schematics— oh, you're on the phone? I'll just reorganize the periodic table wall chart. Again."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "Not now, Gerald!"

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "Who is Gerald?! IS GERALD CLEARED?!"

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "He's my research assistant. He alphabetizes things. He's cleared for absolutely nothing."

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "Alphabetizing is a COVER. The oldest cover there is."

NERDY CHICKEN: "Actually, statistically speaking, alphabetizing predates most documented cover operations by approximately four hundred years, so technically—"

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "EXACTLY WHAT A COVER WOULD SAY."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "What do you WANT from me?!"

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "We need the Jungle-Tron 9000. The fate of the entire rainforest canopy layer depends on it."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "...It only blows leaves."

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "...The leaves are load-bearing."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: *very long pause* "I'm going to need you to explain that."

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "Meet us at the third fig tree past the waterfall. Come alone. Bring Gerald."

NERDY CHICKEN: "Oh! Fig trees! Did you know figs are technically inverted flowers? This rendezvous sounds scientifically very promising!"

JITTERY PANGOLIN: "How is this my life."

CONSPIRATORIAL OWL: "One last thing. The device. Does it also... do laundry? Asking for a colleague."

JITTERY PANGOLIN: *hangs up* *stares at leaf blower for a full ten seconds* *slowly picks the phone back up* "...Hello? You said load-bearing?"
