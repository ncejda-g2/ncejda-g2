# Today's Improv (2026-01-08)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 26**

A theatrical lemur and a frugal demon are news anchors reporting on bizarre events underwater

---

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "Good evening, citizens of the deep! I'm your host, bringing you DRAMA, INTRIGUE, and BREAKING NEWS from beneath the waves!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "And I'm the co-anchor who keeps reminding everyone we're paying for this broadcast by the minute, so let's wrap it up."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "Our top story tonight—a vindictive maple tree has somehow ended up in the ocean and is TERRORIZING local fish populations!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "We could've just tweeted that. Why do we need a whole segment?"

THEATRICAL LEMUR: *gestures dramatically* "Because journalism is an ART! Now, let's go live to the scene—"

FRUGAL DEMON: "We're not going live. Do you know how much underwater satellite costs? We're showing stock footage."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "But the people DESERVE to see—"

VINDICTIVE MAPLE TREE: *floats by in background* "I'LL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LUMBERJACK! NEVER!"

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "THERE! Did you see that? RIVETING television! This is why we do what we do!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "That was free content that literally swam past us. I'll allow it."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "In other news, mysterious bubbles have been spotted rising from the Mariana Trench, and experts believe it could be—"

FRUGAL DEMON: "Fish farts. It's fish farts. Moving on."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "You can't just—that's not—where's your sense of MYSTERY? Your passion for the UNKNOWN?"

FRUGAL DEMON: "I left it on the surface where it doesn't cost me extra in water pressure insurance."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "This just in! A school of dolphins has formed a UNION and is demanding better working conditions!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "Are they paying for ad space? No? Then that's not news, that's free publicity."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "It's a LABOR MOVEMENT! The proletariat of the sea are RISING UP!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "The only thing rising is our production budget every time you use hand gestures. Those create currents. Currents cost money."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "How can you be a demon of the underworld yet be so UNBEARABLY practical about everything?!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "Hell has a very strict budget. Do you know how much fire costs to maintain? We had to switch to energy-efficient flames."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "I'm getting word that a kraken has been spotted near—"

FRUGAL DEMON: "Is it a sponsored kraken? Did it buy a segment?"

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "That's not how NEWS works!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "It is now. We're underwater. The rules are different down here. I literally negotiated our studio lease for three clams and a shiny bottle cap."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: *tail dramatically sweeping* "Fine! FINE! Then let me at least do the weather with FLAIR!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "The weather is wet. We're underwater. You're done."

THEATRICAL LEMUR: "And that's our broadcast for tonight! Remember, citizens—stay curious, stay informed, and stay FABULOUS!"

FRUGAL DEMON: "And remember to conserve oxygen. Those tanks aren't cheap. Good night."
