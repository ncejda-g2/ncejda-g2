# Today's Improv (2026-02-03)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 52**

A hungry horse, an unrepentant cat, and a sanctimonious armadillo are submarine captains giving a TED talk while their submarine is actively sinking in the clouds

---

HUNGRY HORSE: "And that concludes slide 47 of my presentation on 'Leadership Through Crisis.' Questions?"

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "Yes, I have a question. Why is there water coming through the ceiling?"

HUNGRY HORSE: "That's actually slide 52. We'll get there."

UNREPENTANT CAT: *lounging on the podium* "I sabotaged the hull."

HUNGRY HORSE: "What?"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "Yeah, about twenty minutes ago. We're at 400 feet and dropping. Anyway, continue."

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "You WHAT?! This is UNETHICAL! We have AUDIENCE MEMBERS!"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "There's literally three of us here."

HUNGRY HORSE: "Can we circle back to this after my talk? I haven't eaten in four hours and I really need this speaking fee."

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "The submarine is SINKING through CLOUDS! How is that even PHYSICALLY possible?!"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "I didn't say I understood the sabotage, I just said I did it."

AUDIENCE MEMBER: *raises flipper from the one seat* "Excuse me, when will refreshments be served?"

HUNGRY HORSE: "THANK YOU! Finally someone asking the important questions!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "We need to evacuate! This is a DISASTER! Where are the emergency protocols?!"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "Also ate those."

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "You ate the PROTOCOLS?!"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "They were laminated. Very crunchy."

HUNGRY HORSE: *stomach growling* "Were they any good?"

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "Focus! We're PLUMMETING!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "Right, right. Okay, so slide 48 is actually about 'Maintaining Composure Under Pressure'—"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "Oh, the irony is *chef's kiss*."

AUDIENCE MEMBER: "Will there be a Q&A portion?"

HUNGRY HORSE: "Yes! After slides 48 through 51, assuming we're still alive."

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "This is MADNESS! I'm activating the emergency surfacing system!"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "That button launches confetti now. I got bored."

*confetti explodes everywhere*

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "WHY WOULD YOU—"

HUNGRY HORSE: "Ooh, festive! This really elevates the presentation aesthetic."

AUDIENCE MEMBER: "Is the confetti gluten-free?"

HUNGRY HORSE: *eyes lighting up* "Wait, can you EAT the confetti?"

UNREPENTANT CAT: "No, it's plastic. But don't let that stop you."

SANCTIMONIOUS ARMADILLO: "We are FIFTY FEET from impact with whatever is below clouds and you're discussing DIETARY RESTRICTIONS?!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "In my defense, I specifically mentioned I was hungry at the START of this talk."

UNREPENTANT CAT: "To be fair, he really did."

AUDIENCE MEMBER: "Are we going to die?"

ALL THREE: "Probably!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "But first—slide 48!"
