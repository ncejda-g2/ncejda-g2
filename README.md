# Today's Improv (2026-02-15)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 64**

A theatrical bear must teach improv comedy to a geeky dragon and a hoity-toity oak tree who are overly serious funeral directors in outer space

---

THEATRICAL BEAR: "Welcome, welcome to 'Laughing Through Loss: Improv for Funeral Professionals!' I'm Biscuit, and today we're going to loosen up those stiff, somber vibes!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "I don't understand. I brought my calculator and a spreadsheet of grief metrics. Where do I sit?"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "This is preposterous. I've been conducting funerals in zero gravity for 400 years. I hardly need lessons from a... bear."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "Perfect! Let's start with a classic improv exercise: 'Yes, And!' I'll begin. 'I'm sorry for your loss, the deceased loved space tacos.'"

GEEKY DRAGON: "No, they didn't. According to their file, they were lactose intolerant and—"

THEATRICAL BEAR: "NOPE! That's 'No, But!' In improv, we say 'Yes, And!' Try again!"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "This is beneath my dignity. My roots are literally fossilized from centuries of presiding over dignified ceremonies."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "Okay, Dragon, your turn! The family says, 'We want to celebrate Uncle Jerry's life with interpretive dance.' What do you say?"

GEEKY DRAGON: "I would consult regulation 7.3.2 of the Intergalactic Funeral Code, which clearly states that—"

THEATRICAL BEAR: "You're killing me! And I'm a professional mourner, so that's saying something!"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "Perhaps if we understood the POINT of this frivolity, we might participate more effectively."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "The point is that grief is heavy! Sometimes people need permission to laugh! To remember joy! Not everything has to be... whatever this is!" *gestures at both of them*

GEEKY DRAGON: "I once told a widow that her husband's death statistics were within normal parameters for his age bracket. She threw her asteroid at me."

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "I informed a grieving son that his father's casket was crafted from lesser wood than my own bark. He filed a complaint with the Space Council."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "YES! See? You're TOO serious! Let's try again. I'm the grieving widow. Go!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "Um... your husband is... in a better place? Statistically speaking, heaven has a 73% approval rating?"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "My condolences. Your husband was... adequate. Not exceptional, but adequate."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "I'M GOING TO SCREAM INTO THE VACUUM OF SPACE."

GEEKY DRAGON: "Wait! I have an idea. What if we... what if we told the widow her husband would have found the funeral arrangements... satisfactory?"

THEATRICAL BEAR: "Okay, warmer, but—"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "Or perhaps we could mention that the deceased had... acceptable taste in memorial music?"

THEATRICAL BEAR: "You're both hopeless. Let me demonstrate. 'I'm so sorry for your loss. Your husband was clearly loved, and today we celebrate a life well-lived!' See? Warmth! Heart!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "But what if the life wasn't well-lived? What if he was a space pirate who stole my lunch money in third grade?"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "Or what if he once described me as 'just a tree' in front of the Galactic Botanical Society?"

THEATRICAL BEAR: "Then you LIE! With ENTHUSIASM! That's literally what I'm paid to do!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "That seems... dishonest. I have a moral subroutine that prevents—"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "I have never told a lie in four centuries. My bark rings would show the deception."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "Okay, new exercise! Let's do a scene. Dragon, you're planning a funeral. Tree, you're the client. I'll watch. Go!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "Hello. I have prepared seventeen casket options, ranked by efficiency, cost, and aerodynamics."

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "Are any of them made from mahogany? I only associate with premium hardwoods."

GEEKY DRAGON: "Option twelve is mahogany, but it has a 3.7% chance of cosmic ray deterioration."

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "Unacceptable. I shall source my own casket from my personal forest."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "STOP! THIS IS A FUNERAL, NOT A BOARD MEETING!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "What if the deceased WANTED a board meeting?"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "I once conducted a funeral that was literally a board meeting. The deceased was CEO of SpaceEx. Very efficient."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "I quit. I officially quit. You can't teach improv to people who are literally made of rigidity!"

GEEKY DRAGON: "Wait! Don't go! I'll try harder! Watch: 'Yes, and... and the deceased loved... um... fun?'"

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "Yes, and they were... not entirely terrible as a person?"

THEATRICAL BEAR: "...you know what? That's the worst 'Yes, And' I've ever heard, but at least you tried. Baby steps."

GEEKY DRAGON: "Does this mean we pass the class? I need this for my continuing education credits."

HOITY-TOITY OAK TREE: "I require a certificate to display among my many prestigious awards."

THEATRICAL BEAR: "You both get a C-minus and a recommendation for therapy. Class dismissed."
