A pessimistic giraffe must teach a trust fall workshop to a vindictive woman at an amusement park corporate retreat

---

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Welcome to Trust Falls 101. I'm Gary. Before we begin, I should mention that statistically, 73% of trust falls end in betrayal."

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "Is that an actual statistic or are you just making that up?"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Does it matter? Either way, someone's dropping you."

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "I already don't trust you, and we just met."

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Perfect! That's actually the ideal starting point for this exercise. Now, the government doesn't WANT you to know this, but trust falls were invented by the CIA in 1962 to—"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "Wait, are you a conspiracy theorist?"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "I prefer 'independently informed.' Now, turn around and fall backwards. I'll catch you. Probably."

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "PROBABLY?!"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Look, I'm being realistic here. My arms are basically twigs attached to a seventeen-foot frame. The physics are NOT in your favor."

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "Why are YOU teaching this workshop?!"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Corporate mandated it after I sent that company-wide email about how the office water cooler is definitely bugged. Apparently this is 'team building' and 'addressing my trust issues.'"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "YOU have trust issues? I got assigned here because I refused to collaborate with Brad from accounting after he stole my lunch!"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Was it a sandwich?"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "It was a SALAD, and I'd been thinking about it ALL MORNING!"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "See, THIS is why trust falls are a scam. Brad steals your salad, but YOU'RE the one forced to fall backwards into a stranger's arms. The system is broken."

DECREPIT HEDGEHOG: *wheeling by in a roller coaster cart* "Has anyone seen my dentures?!"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "Why are we doing this at an AMUSEMENT PARK anyway?!"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Because the conference room was 'mysteriously' double-booked. I suspect interference from Big Carnival. They're in cahoots with the bounce house industrial complex."

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "You know what? Fine. I'll do the trust fall. But if you drop me, I'm taking you down with me."

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Now THAT'S the spirit of corporate synergy! Mutually assured destruction. Very team-oriented."

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "On three. One... two—"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Wait! I haven't told you about the chemicals they put in the funnel cake stands to make you more compliant!"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "THREE!"

*crash*

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "I caught you! Sort of! Your foot landed in my hoof!"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "I TRUSTED YOU!"

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "And look where that got you! This is exactly what I've been trying to teach! Trust is a LIE perpetuated by greeting card companies!"

VINDICTIVE WOMAN: "I'm putting you on my list, Gary. Right between Brad and the guy who spoiled the season finale."

PESSIMISTIC GIRAFFE: "Jokes on you—I'm already on thirteen different lists! Three are government watchlists!"

DECREPIT HEDGEHOG: *rolling past again* "Found them! They were in the teacup ride!"
