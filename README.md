A hippie man and a punk hedgehog witness an aging butler fighting for her inheritance in the Fairy Tale Forest

---

HIPPIE MAN: "*sitting cross-legged under a tree* Whoa, man, do you feel that? The forest's energy is, like, totally chaotic today."

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "*spray-painting graffiti on a toadstool* Yeah, dude. It's probably because of that ancient badger in the butler uniform screaming at that oak tree."

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "*shaking her fist at the tree* YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST GROW THERE AND MOCK ME?! I SERVED THE FAIRWEATHER FAMILY FOR SIXTY-THREE YEARS!"

HIPPIE MAN: "Oh man, that's some heavy negative vibes. Should we, like, intervene? Spread some peace?"

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "Nah, let's watch. This is way more entertaining than my existential crisis about conformity."

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "*turning to them* YOU TWO! You're witnesses! Tell the magistrate that I, Gertrude Von Whiskers, am the RIGHTFUL heir to the Fairweather Fortune!"

HIPPIE MAN: "Uh, we just got here, sister. We don't know anything about your fortune, but I can offer you some crystals for inner harmony?"

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "I DON'T NEED CRYSTALS! I need LEGAL DOCUMENTATION proving that Lady Fairweather left everything to ME and not to her ungrateful nephew, REGINALD!"

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "*stops spray-painting* Wait, Reginald? That pompous squirrel in the top hat? That guy's the WORST. He told me my quills were 'unkempt.'"

REGINALD THE SQUIRREL: "*emerging from behind a bush in a velvet waistcoat* Gertrude, PLEASE. This is unbecoming. Auntie left her estate to FAMILY, not the help."

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "THE HELP?! I raised you, you ungrateful acorn-hoarder! I taught you how to use a FORK!"

HIPPIE MAN: "*standing up peacefully* Okay, okay, let's all just breathe. In... and out... Can't we all just share the inheritance? Possessions are just, like, illusions anyway, man."

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "No, no, I'm with Gertrude on this one. Reginald's a poser. I say we settle this with a battle of the bands."

REGINALD THE SQUIRREL: "A WHAT?!"

ROTUND SENTIENT MUSHROOM: "*suddenly popping out of the ground* Did someone say BATTLE?! I'll be the judge! I've been growing here for 400 years! I've seen EVERYTHING!"

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "This is NOT about music! This is about my LIFE'S WORK! My DIGNITY!"

HIPPIE MAN: "Heavy, man. But like, what if the REAL inheritance was the friends we made along the way?"

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "Dude, we literally just met these people five minutes ago."

HIPPIE MAN: "Exactly! Cosmic connections, bro!"

ROTUND SENTIENT MUSHROOM: "*authoritatively* According to Forest Law Section 42, subsection 7, inheritance disputes must be settled by... *checks notes made of moss* ...whoever can find Lady Fairweather's hidden will first."

REGINALD THE SQUIRREL: "Hidden will? But I already HAVE the will!"

ROTUND SENTIENT MUSHROOM: "That's the FAKE will. The real one is hidden somewhere in this forest. Lady Fairweather told me on her deathbed. Said something about 'testing their worthiness.'"

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "*eyes narrowing* She WOULD do something like that. She loved games."

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "Yo, this just turned into a treasure hunt! Can we join?"

HIPPIE MAN: "Man, I'm in! This is way better than my vision quest!"

REGINALD THE SQUIRREL: "*adjusting his monocle nervously* This is PREPOSTEROUS! I'm calling my lawyer!"

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "*cracking her knuckles* You do that, Reginald. Meanwhile, I'm going to search every mushroom circle, fairy ring, and enchanted glade until I find that will!"

ROTUND SENTIENT MUSHROOM: "First clue: It's buried where the moonlight never touches and the moss grows thickest."

HIPPIE MAN: "Whoa, that's like... everywhere in a forest, man."

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "Yeah, this is gonna take forever. I respect that. Let's burn the system down by participating in it ironically."

ELDERLY BADGER BUTLER: "*already marching off* FOLLOW ME OR DON'T! I'M GETTING WHAT'S MINE!"

REGINALD THE SQUIRREL: "*scrambling after her* WAIT! GERTRUDE! Let's discuss this rationally!"

ROTUND SENTIENT MUSHROOM: "*calling after them* My legal fees are three acorns per hour!"

HIPPIE MAN: "*to the hedgehog* Should we tell them the mushroom isn't actually a lawyer?"

PUNK HEDGEHOG: "Nah. This is the most punk thing I've ever witnessed. A badger butler versus capitalism."
