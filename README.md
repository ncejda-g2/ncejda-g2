# Today's Improv (2025-12-27)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 14**

A wizard unicorn and a wise robot are time travelers trying to fit into a different era in a robot factory

---

WIZARD UNICORN: "Okay, we traveled back to 1987. Act natural. Fit in with the factory workers."

WISE ROBOT: "Understood. *beep boop* I am a normal human person doing normal human work activities."

WIZARD UNICORN: "That's... that's literally the worst impression I've ever heard."

WISE ROBOT: "I calculated a 73% probability of success. The workers appear confused but accepting."

FACTORY FOREMAN: "*walks over* Uh, why is there a glowing unicorn and a talking toaster in my assembly line?"

WIZARD UNICORN: "*nervous laugh* Toaster? We're just... very dedicated to the 80s aesthetic. I'm wearing leg warmers. See?"

FACTORY FOREMAN: "You're a horse. Horses don't wear pants."

WISE ROBOT: "Technically, this unit classifies as a 'prototype'. Observe my authentic 1987 features: floppy disk drive, beige plastic casing—"

WIZARD UNICORN: "He's from the future! I mean, the present! THIS present! Your present!"

FACTORY FOREMAN: "Are you two industrial spies? Because the Johnson Corporation already tried sending a guy in a bear costume last month."

WISE ROBOT: "Negative. Our mission is purely observational. We merely seek to understand the primitive manufacturing techniques of this era."

WIZARD UNICORN: "*kicks robot* PRIMITIVE?! He means... charmingly retro!"

FACTORY FOREMAN: "Look, I don't get paid enough for this. Can you solder?"

WIZARD UNICORN: "Can I SOLDER? I'm a wizard! I can cast Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Summon Snacks—"

WISE ROBOT: "Affirmative. This unit possesses welding appendages."

FACTORY FOREMAN: "*shrugs* Fine. Station 7. Don't set anything on fire."

WIZARD UNICORN: "*whispers* That went well! We're blending in perfectly!"

WISE ROBOT: "Query: Why is everyone staring at us?"

WIZARD UNICORN: "Because we're NAILING this! Time travel espionage is easier than I thought!"

FACTORY WORKER: "*eating lunch nearby* Hey, isn't that the same unicorn from the Renaissance Fair?"

WIZARD UNICORN: "ABORT MISSION! ABORT MISSION!"

WISE ROBOT: "*calmly* I shall activate the temporal displacement device. Please hold my hoof."

WIZARD UNICORN: "That's my horn, you're grabbing my—"

*FWOOOOSH*

FACTORY FOREMAN: "*sips coffee* ...I need a vacation."
