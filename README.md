# Today's Improv (2026-01-12)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 30**

A grumpy giraffe and a hippie witch confront the chaos of autocorrect in a medieval wizard's tower

---

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "I've been a scribe for fifteen years. FIFTEEN. And now my quill is correcting my spelling."

HIPPIE WITCH: "Oh yeah, I enchanted that for you! You're welcome, man. I figured it would, like, help with your whole 'perfectionist' vibe."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "Help? HELP?! I tried to write 'The king doth decree' and it changed it to 'The king doth DECAF.'"

HIPPIE WITCH: "I mean, the king probably needs to cut back on caffeine. Have you seen him? He's super jittery."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "That's not the point! Yesterday I was transcribing a royal proclamation and it autocorrected 'Battle of Hastings' to 'Battle of HASHTAGS.'"

HIPPIE WITCH: "Okay, that's actually pretty cosmic. Maybe the universe is trying to tell you something about the nature of warfare and social media—"

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "There IS no social media! It's 1387!"

HIPPIE WITCH: "Not with that attitude there isn't."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "Do you know what happened when I wrote the Lord's prayer for the chapel? It changed 'hallowed be thy name' to 'HOLLOWED BE THY MEME.'"

HIPPIE WITCH: "Okay, even I have to admit that's hilarious."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "The priest CRIED. He thought it was a sign of the apocalypse!"

HIPPIE WITCH: "I can remove the enchantment, but like, have you considered that maybe your quill is just more enlightened than you?"

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "This morning I tried to write 'peasant uprising' and it changed it to 'PLEASANT UPRISING.' Do you know how confusing that is for historical records?!"

HIPPIE WITCH: "Honestly? I think we need more pleasant uprisings. The energy would be way better."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "I'm a GIRAFFE. Do you know how hard it is to use a quill with hooves? And now I have to fight with it about VOCABULARY?!"

HIPPIE WITCH: "Have you tried, like, talking to it? Maybe it's just misunderstood."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "It's a QUILL. With autocorrect. That you enchanted. Because you were 'bored' and wanted to 'spread good vibes.'"

HIPPIE WITCH: "I stand by my choices."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "I tried to document a plague outbreak and it changed 'Black Death' to 'SNACK BREATH.'"

HIPPIE WITCH: "...Okay, I'm definitely removing that enchantment now."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "THANK YOU."

HIPPIE WITCH: "But first, can you write one more thing with it? I want to see what it does with 'remove this cursed enchantment immediately.'"

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: *sighs and writes* "It says 'REMOVE THIS BLESSED ENCHILADA IMMEDIATELY.'"

HIPPIE WITCH: "You know what? On second thought, this enchantment is a masterpiece. I'm leaving it."

GRUMPY GIRAFFE: "I HATE YOU SO MUCH."
