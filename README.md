# Today's Improv (2026-02-13)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 62**

A machiavellian newt and a smug bear mediate a relationship crisis between a volcano and its village in the city

---

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Welcome to Couples Therapy. I'm Dr. Newt, and I've reviewed your case file. Village of Pomford, you've been together with Mount Blazington for... 800 years?"

SMUG BEAR: "Actually, I'm representing the volcano today. Mount Blazington couldn't make it—he's literally a geological formation."

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "I see. And you are?"

SMUG BEAR: "Bear-ister Marcus Grizzwald, attorney at claw. My client has been defamed, harassed, and frankly, insulted by these villagers for centuries."

VILLAGE ELDER: "We bring you sacrifices every month! Premium goats! We sing to you!"

SMUG BEAR: "Oh, you mean the BRIBES? The pathetic attempts to manipulate my client's volcanic activity? Classic toxic relationship behavior."

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Interesting. Let me play devil's advocate here—and trust me, I'm very good at that. Village, what do YOU need from this relationship?"

VILLAGE ELDER: "We just want to NOT DIE. Is that too much to ask?"

SMUG BEAR: "See? Everything is about THEM. Never once asking 'How are you feeling, Mount Blazington?' or 'What can WE do for YOU?'"

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Bear-ister Grizzwald raises a valid point. When's the last time you asked the volcano about its needs?"

VILLAGE ELDER: "It's a VOLCANO. Its needs are being hot and occasionally murderous!"

SMUG BEAR: "WOW. Body shaming AND emotional dismissal. My client is a complex geological system with pressure needs, magma flow issues, and you're reducing him to a stereotype."

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Let me propose a solution that benefits me—I mean, both parties. Village pays ME a monthly retainer, volcano agrees to a venting schedule, and I broker all future communications. Everyone wins. Especially me."

VILLAGE ELDER: "That's extortion!"

SMUG BEAR: "My client is willing to settle for three virgins a month—"

VILLAGE ELDER: "We did that in medieval times! We've evolved! We offer yoga instructors now!"

SMUG BEAR: "And my client finds your downward dog insulting to his upward lava flows."

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Gentlemen, let's focus on the real issue. Village, you fear abandonment—by way of incineration. Volcano, you feel taken for granted. These are universal relationship struggles."

VILLAGE ELDER: "He literally erupted during our harvest festival last year!"

SMUG BEAR: "Because you FORGOT his eruption anniversary! Do you know how that made him feel? Of course not, because you never asked!"

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "I'm sensing some projection here, Bear-ister. Is this about YOUR needs?"

SMUG BEAR: "This isn't about me. Though yes, I also feel underappreciated. Being a volcanic legal representative is HARD. Nobody respects magma law anymore."

VILLAGE ELDER: "Can we just sign a peace treaty or something?"

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Treaties are my specialty. For a small fee of 40% of your annual GDP, I'll draft something that technically binds you both while containing enough loopholes that I'll be employed for decades handling disputes."

SMUG BEAR: "My client demands an apology first. A REAL one. With feeling."

VILLAGE ELDER: "Fine! Dear Mount Blazington, I'm sorry we've taken you for granted. We appreciate your... warmth? And your... geological contributions to our tourism industry?"

SMUG BEAR: "He accepts. That'll be 50,000 in legal fees."

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Excellent. Same time next week? The volcano still has unresolved childhood trauma from being called a 'dormant little hill' by neighboring mountains."

VILLAGE ELDER: "We can't afford weekly therapy!"

MACHIAVELLIAN NEWT: "Then I guess you'll just have to deal with the emotional eruptions. Your choice."
