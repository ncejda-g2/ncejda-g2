A conspiratorial demon is a teacher dealing with bizarre student excuses in an underwater city

---

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Alright class, settle down. I KNOW what you're all thinking. 'Why do we have to study marine biology when we LIVE underwater?' Well, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Now, who didn't turn in their homework on ocean currents? Ah, yes, Timmy the anglerfish. Let me guess your excuse."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: *whispers* "And before you answer, know that I've heard EVERYTHING. The Illuminati of the Abyss keeps files on all of you."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Go ahead, Timmy."

TIMMY: "My light bulb burned out and I couldn't see to write—"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "CONVENIENT! Very convenient that your BIOLUMINESCENCE just HAPPENED to fail on homework night! Did it occur to you that maybe the Kraken Control Committee doesn't WANT you learning about currents?!"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Next! Susie the seahorse. Where's your essay?"

SUSIE: "A shark ate it—"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "A SHARK. ATE. YOUR. ESSAY. Do you know what sharks are, Susie? They're GOVERNMENT DRONES. Wake up! Have you ever seen a shark blink? NO. Because they have CAMERA EYES."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "And let me guess—this shark SPECIFICALLY targeted YOUR essay and nothing else?"

SUSIE: "Well, it also ate my lunch—"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "CLASSIC misdirection! Make it look random! But I know better. I've been teaching in this underwater city for 300 years, and every time budget cuts happen, suddenly MORE sharks appear. Coincidence? I THINK NOT."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Tommy the turtle, I don't see your project on coral reefs."

TOMMY: "I'm still working on it. I'm a turtle, things take time—"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "THAT'S what Big Turtle wants you to believe! 'Oh, I'm slow, it's my NATURE.' But I've seen the TRUTH! I've seen turtles moving at REGULAR SPEED when they think no one's watching!"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "The whole 'slow turtle' thing is a PSYOP to lower academic expectations! You're all capable of SO MUCH MORE if you'd just OPEN YOUR EYES!"

RANDOM JELLYFISH: *drifts by window*

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "SEE THAT?! That jellyfish just HAPPENED to float by during our lesson? That's surveillance! They're EVERYWHERE! Brainless? HA! That's what they WANT you to think!"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Now, everyone open your textbooks to page 47. But notice how page 47 is ALWAYS where the important information is? That's not random! The number 47 appears in EVERY major underwater historical event!"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "The Great Reef Collapse? 47 years before the first underwater city. The Treaty of Atlantis? Signed in the year ending in 47. The invention of waterproof paper? EXACTLY 47 days after someone said it was impossible!"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "And before anyone asks, YES, your final exam is still on Friday. Unless... unless THEY decide to cancel school. Which they MIGHT, if too many of you start asking the RIGHT questions."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Homework for tonight: I want a 500-word essay on why dolphins are suspiciously intelligent. THINK ABOUT IT. They're mammals... living underwater... with SONAR... that they use to 'communicate.' Or is it to COORDINATE?"

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: "Class dismissed. Exit in pairs. NEVER swim alone. And if anyone asks, we spent today learning about phytoplankton, NOT THE TRUTH."

CONSPIRATORIAL DEMON: *mutters while erasing board* "These kids today... no appreciation for the LAYERS of deception around them... In MY day, we questioned EVERYTHING... even water itself..."
