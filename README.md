**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 63**

A nervous armadillo life insurance salesman attempts to pitch services to a smug immortal beetle in the microscopic world

---

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "T-thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Beetle. I represent MicroLife Insurance, and I'd love to discuss your... um... mortality coverage needs?"

SMUG BEETLE: "Mortality coverage? How quaint. I achieved immortality 3,000 years ago. I literally watched the dinosaurs die."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "Right! Yes! That's actually... that's great! But have you considered what happens if you're... accidentally stepped on? Or... squished?"

SMUG BEETLE: "I can regenerate from a single cell. Try again, armadillo."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "Okay, okay. What about... existential dread coverage? After living forever, you might experience a crisis of—"

SMUG BEETLE: "Already had twelve of those. Boring. Next pitch."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "Look, I've been doing this for six weeks and you're my first appointment! My manager said if I don't sell something today, I'm fired!"

SMUG BEETLE: "And why is that my problem?"

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "Because I have a wife! Three hundred babies! Armadillos always have multiples! Do you know how expensive tiny little armadillo shoes are?!"

SMUG BEETLE: "I literally ruled ancient Egypt. I was worshipped as a god. Your financial problems are beneath me. Literally and figuratively—you're also much smaller than me."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "What if... what if we offered immortality INSURANCE? Like, insurance AGAINST being immortal?"

SMUG BEETLE: "...I'm listening."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "If you ever get tired of living forever, we'll... uh... help you find meaning in eternal existence? Premium therapy sessions? A support group?"

SMUG BEETLE: "The only other immortal I know is a narcissistic fungus who won't stop talking about cryptocurrency. Continue."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "We have a special clause! If you're ever bored for more than 500 consecutive years, we'll introduce you to NEW immortals! Fresh perspectives!"

SMUG BEETLE: "Define 'fresh.'"

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "Well, there's a cockroach who claims he'll outlive the heat death of the universe. Very upbeat guy. Loves jazz."

SMUG BEETLE: "Jazz? The cockroach has taste. What's the premium?"

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "For someone of your... infinite lifespan... we're looking at monthly payments until the end of time."

SMUG BEETLE: "So you want me to pay FOREVER for insurance against living FOREVER?"

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "When you say it like that, it sounds bad."

SMUG BEETLE: "It IS bad. That's literally the worst business model I've heard in three millennia."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "I can offer you a 2% discount?"

SMUG BEETLE: "Two percent off of infinity is still infinity, you absolute fool."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "What if I just... curl up into a ball right here and cry? Would that help?"

SMUG BEETLE: "You know what? Fine. I'll buy your worthless policy. Not because I need it, but because watching you grovel has been the most entertaining thing I've witnessed since the Bronze Age collapsed."

NERVOUS ARMADILLO: "Really?! Oh thank you, thank you! You won't regret this! Or... you will, but forever, so you'll have time to process it!"

SMUG BEETLE: "I already regret it. Which proves your product works. Well played, armadillo."
