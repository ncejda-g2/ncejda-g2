# Today's Improv (2025-12-16)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 3**

A frugal horse and a hippie dinosaur are in Fairy Tale Forest where a psychic adopts a baby but gets more than he bargained for

---

FRUGAL HORSE: "Listen, I'm telling you, this adoption agency is a complete ripoff. Twenty-seven magic beans for the application fee alone!"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "Bro, you gotta release that materialistic energy. The universe provides, man. Like, I just manifested this flower crown out of pure vibes."

FRUGAL HORSE: "You BOUGHT that at the enchanted market for three gold coins. I saw you."

PSYCHIC (off-stage, panicked): "SOMEONE HELP! THE BABY IS READING MY THOUGHTS!"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "Whoa, cosmic. Maybe the baby is like, an old soul, you know? We're all just stardust experiencing itself, even babies."

FRUGAL HORSE: "Or maybe the psychic should have READ THE FINE PRINT on the adoption scroll before signing. I bet there were hidden fees about telepathic infants."

PSYCHIC: "*stumbles into clearing holding a glowing baby* This child knows EVERYTHING. My PIN numbers, my browser history, my secret shame about the time I pretended to predict the stock market but actually just Googled it!"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "Far out! The baby's like a tiny guru! Can I hold them? I wanna see if they can access my past life as a sentient fern."

FRUGAL HORSE: "Absolutely not. Do you know how much liability insurance costs in this forest? Last week a dragon sneezed on someone and the premiums went through the roof."

PSYCHIC: "It's worse than you think! The baby just mentally transmitted the lottery numbers for next week, but they're in BINARY CODE. I can't even enjoy my premonitions anymore!"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "Maybe you need to like, center yourself, man. Have you tried meditation? Or eating this mushroom I found? It's either enlightening or poisonous, I can never remember which."

BABY: "*gurgles and suddenly everyone hears a voice in their head* I KNOW YOU'RE ALL AVOIDING YOUR TAXES."

FRUGAL HORSE: "*gasps* I FILED AN EXTENSION! THAT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL!"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "Taxes are just a construct, baby dude. Money is an illusion. We should all just barter with positive energy and—"

BABY: "YOU OWE THE KINGDOM 47 GOLD COINS IN BACK TAXES FROM YOUR CRYSTAL HEALING PYRAMID SCHEME."

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "It wasn't a SCHEME, it was a LIFESTYLE COMMUNITY! There's a difference!"

PSYCHIC: "*on the verge of tears* I thought adopting a baby would complete me! Give my life meaning! Maybe help me finally move out of my mother's tower!"

FRUGAL HORSE: "Well clearly you should have gone with a goldfish. Low maintenance, no telepathy, and you can buy them in bulk with a coupon."

BABY: "THE HORSE IS RIGHT. ALSO, YOUR MOTHER WANTS YOU TO CALL HER. SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU."

PSYCHIC: "How can you possibly know—oh right, psychic baby. This is my life now."

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "You know what? This is beautiful, man. We're all connected through this enlightened infant. It's like we're one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively through—"

BABY: "YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU READ IT ON A BUMPER STICKER. YOUR ACTUAL THOUGHTS ARE 90% WONDERING IF LEAVES ARE STILL GOOD AFTER THEY TURN BROWN."

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "...that's personal, tiny dude."

FRUGAL HORSE: "Well, I'm invoicing everyone here for my time. This interaction has cost me approximately eight minutes of grazing, which at current hay prices comes to—"

BABY: "NO ONE IS GOING TO PAY YOU. ALSO, YOU'RE GOING TO STEP ON A NAIL NEXT TUESDAY. I'M WARNING YOU NOW BECAUSE TETANUS SHOTS ARE EXPENSIVE."

FRUGAL HORSE: "...I'm listening."

PSYCHIC: "*sighs deeply* Anyone want to adopt a baby? Gently used, one previous owner, comes with existential dread and the ability to expose all your darkest secrets?"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "Does the baby come with papers? Like, adoption papers? Because I spent all my coins on that flower crown and—"

ALL THREE: "*stare at Hippie Dinosaur*"

HIPPIE DINOSAUR: "What? I thought we were being honest now."
