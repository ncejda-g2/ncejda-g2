# Today's Improv (2026-02-04)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 53**

A melodramatic ghoul, an insufferable snail, and a hungry squirrel are in a musical where every line is a song in a futuristic city

---

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 The neon lights are FADING, my soul is full of WOEEEEE! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Actually, those lights are LED, they don't fade, you knooooow! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 Does anyone have SNACKS? My stomach's in DESPAIR! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 This is a MUSICAL, not a CAFETERIA, I SWAAAAEAR! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Well technically, in Act Two of Hamilton, there's food mentioned several tiiiiimes! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 HAMILTON HAD SNACKS?! That changes ALL my paradigms! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 Can we FOCUS on the PLOT? My character arc is DEEP! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Your character arc is derivative of Sweeney Todd meets Sleep! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 HOW DARE YOU! My pain is ORIGINAL and TRUE! 🎵"

HOVER-TAXI DRIVER: *flies past* "🎵 Hey you three! You're blocking traffic, BOO! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 Excuse me driver, do you have any PEANUTS to spare? 🎵"

HOVER-TAXI DRIVER: "🎵 I have ALLERGIES, your question fills me with DESPAIR! 🎵" *flies away*

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 That rhyme was lazy and the melody was uninspiiiiired! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 Unlike MY performance, which is PASSIONATE and FIIIIRED! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 I'm losing focus, I need CARBS to understaaaand! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Your blood sugar issues aren't part of the playwright's plaaaaan! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 The playwright is a HACK! They don't understand my PAAAAAAIN! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 The playwright is literally standing right there in the rain! 🎵"

PLAYWRIGHT: *in the distance, holding a script* "🎵 I'm having REGRETS about this entire prodUCTION! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 Can we take FIVE? I need NUTSSSS for my stomach's DESTRUCTION! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 There IS no intermission! We must SUFFER through this ART! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Actually, union rules require breaks after each part! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 THE SNAIL IS RIGHT! Let's GO! To the futuristic food cooooourt! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 You're RUINING the MOMENT! My emotions are RAW and TRUUUUE! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Your emotions are overacted and your pitch is flat tooooo! 🎵"

MELODRAMATIC GHOUL: "🎵 I'll show you FLAT when I collapse from THEATRICAL FATIGUE! 🎵"

HUNGRY SQUIRREL: "🎵 I'll show you FLAT when I faint from hunger mid-LEEEAGUE! 🎵"

INSUFFERABLE SNAIL: "🎵 Neither of those lyrics made ANY sense at ALLLLL! 🎵"

ALL THREE: "🎵 THIS IS WHY MUSICALS ALWAYS FLOOOOOP! 🎵"
