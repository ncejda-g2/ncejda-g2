# Today's Improv (2026-01-23)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 41**

A narcissistic raccoon, an ominous dragon, and a hungry horse are fairy tale characters bartering with absurd items in a swamp

---

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "Gather round, peasants! I'm here to trade my most prized possession—a mirror that only reflects MY gorgeous face!"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "The end times draw near... and I bring forth three cursed beans that whisper your darkest secrets at 3 AM."

HUNGRY HORSE: "I've got half a sandwich I found. It might be tuna. Wait, no, I ate it. Never mind."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "That's not how bartering works! You're supposed to have something TO trade!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "I have regrets about the sandwich."

OMINOUS DRAGON: "The shadow market accepts regrets as currency... but yours are too weak. Too flavorless."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "Okay, Dragon, I'll bite. What do you want for these nightmare beans?"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "I seek... the golden egg of prophecy. Or a decent wifi password. The darkness gets spotty out here."

HUNGRY HORSE: "I know a wifi password! It's 'password123'—wait, that's just every public network I've tried."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "I'll give you my mirror for those beans! Do you know how valuable a mirror that exclusively shows perfection is?"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "It is but a cursed object that traps your vanity for all eternity—"

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "EXACTLY! That's why it's priceless!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "Does anyone have food? I'll trade my horseshoes. Both of them. All four? How many do I have?"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "Four. And they reek of doom."

HUNGRY HORSE: "That's just swamp mud. Smells like doom, tastes like disappointment. I checked."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "Wait, GOLDEN HORSESHOES? Horse, you've been walking on treasure this whole time?!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "These are golden?! I thought they were just... shiny garbage."

OMINOUS DRAGON: "The prophecy foretold of a fool with golden hooves who knows not their worth..."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "I'll take those horseshoes! I'll give you my mirror AND a slightly used tiara!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "Will you give me food?"

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "I have gourmet trash from behind the castle. Barely touched by rats!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "SOLD!"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "And thus, the wheel of fate turns... the raccoon gains wealth, the horse gains sustenance, and I... I gain nothing."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "That's because you brought CURSED BEANS to a barter market! Read the room, Dragon!"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "The room is a swamp."

HUNGRY HORSE: "This trash is amazing. Is that a whole croissant?!"

OMINOUS DRAGON: "I curse you both with mild inconveniences."

NARCISSISTIC RACCOON: "Joke's on you—I'm already mildly inconvenienced by having to look at creatures less attractive than myself!"

HUNGRY HORSE: "Can I also have the beans? They might taste better than that sandwich."
