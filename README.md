# Today's Improv (2026-01-20)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 38**

A wizard dinosaur and a backstabbing demon are life coaches motivating a bridge troll to pursue their true passion instead of collecting tolls in outer space

---

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "Welcome to Cosmic Life Coaching! Now, Bridge Troll, what brings you to our space station today?"

BRIDGE TROLL: "I'm... I'm just so unfulfilled. I've been collecting tolls at the Andromeda Bridge for three thousand years."

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "Three thousand years? And how much have you saved?"

BRIDGE TROLL: "Seventeen dollars. And a button."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "Let's focus on passion, not finances. Tell me, what makes your heart sing?"

BRIDGE TROLL: "Well... I've always wanted to be a florist."

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "FLORIST?! In outer space?! There's no oxygen! Plants can't—"

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "We DON'T crush dreams here, Gary. That's literally in our contract."

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "First of all, my name is Azaroth, Devourer of Souls. Second, I'm just being REALISTIC."

BRIDGE TROLL: "See, this is why I never pursued it. Everyone says it's impossible."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "Nothing is impossible! I'm a DINOSAUR who learned MAGIC. If I can master telekinesis with these tiny arms—"

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "You use a wand. Your arms are completely irrelevant to—"

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "Gary, I swear to the cosmos—"

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "It's AZAROTH!"

BRIDGE TROLL: "Maybe I should just go back to the bridge."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "No! Look, you deserve to flourish! Pun intended. Have you considered hydroponics? Space gardens?"

BRIDGE TROLL: "I... I hadn't thought of that."

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "Actually, you know what? I changed my mind. You should TOTALLY be a florist. In fact, I know a guy who runs a flower shop on Mars. Very exclusive clientele."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "That's suspiciously helpful, Gary."

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "I'm turning over a new leaf! Also pun intended. Also, he needs someone desperate enough to accept payment in Martian currency, which is worthless."

BRIDGE TROLL: "Oh."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "See, THIS is why I work alone! You can't help backstabbing people!"

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "It's literally in my NAME! What did you expect?!"

BRIDGE TROLL: "You know what? I'm going back to the bridge. At least there, I know exactly what I'm getting: disappointment and seventeen dollars."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "Wait! What if we compromised? You could... collect tolls for the space garden? Admission fees?"

BRIDGE TROLL: "That's... actually not terrible."

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "And I could help you overcharge people! Win-win!"

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "Or charge them FAIRLY, building a loyal customer base—"

BRIDGE TROLL: "You two are exhausting. I'm going to open a flower shop AND charge whatever I want. Without either of you."

WIZARD DINOSAUR: "That's the spirit! You're taking charge of your—"

BACKSTABBING DEMON: "Wait, does this mean we don't get our coaching fee?"

BRIDGE TROLL: "You can have the button."
