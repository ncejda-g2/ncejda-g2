EXHAUSTED CAPYBARA: "I can't do this anymore. We've been shrunk to microscopic size for THREE HOURS and I still haven't had my nap."

ELEGANT CAPYBARA: "Darling, compose yourself. We're superheroes. We must maintain our dignity, even when battling bacteria the size of buildings."

GOURMET BEAR: "Speaking of which, is anyone else concerned that these microbes look suspiciously like aged Roquefort? The blue veining, the pungent aroma..."

EXHAUSTED CAPYBARA: "That's literally just mold. On someone's forgotten sandwich. We're fighting mold."

ELEGANT CAPYBARA: "We're not *fighting* mold, we're *neutralizing a biological threat*. Phrasing matters. My cape didn't get dry-cleaned for nothing."

GOURMET BEAR: "Hold on, hold on. Before we destroy it, can I get a sample? This could pair beautifully with a robust Cabernet."

EXHAUSTED CAPYBARA: "We're one millimeter tall. Our greatest enemy right now is a light breeze. And you want cheese samples."

GOURMET BEAR: "When opportunity presents itself in the form of artisanal funk, you don't waste it. That's literally in the superhero handbook I wrote."

ELEGANT CAPYBARA: "You wrote a handbook about cheese?"

GOURMET BEAR: "Chapter seven: 'Turning Villains into Charcuterie Boards.' It's a metaphor. Mostly."

EXHAUSTED CAPYBARA: "I'm going to sleep right here. Wake me when we're normal-sized or when the dust mite cavalry arrives. Whichever comes first."

ELEGANT CAPYBARA: "You absolutely cannot nap on a bacterium. Think of the optics!"

GOURMET BEAR: "Agreed. At least nap on the artisanal mold. It's softer and has notes of walnut."

EXHAUSTED CAPYBARA: "I hate both of you. This is the worst superhero team in any dimension, microscopic or otherwise."
