# Today's Improv (2025-12-19)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 6**

A hoity-toity bee, a brave snail, and an excited armadillo find themselves in a swamp where an aging butler fights for her inheritance

---

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "*adjusting tiny monocle* I'll have you know, I served the Duchess of Marshland for FIFTY years! Fifty years of impeccable service in this wretched swamp!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "*slowly emerging from shell with legal documents* As... the... estate... attorney... I... must... inform... you..."

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "OH MY GOSH, IS THIS A REAL WILL READING?! I've never been to one! This is SO COOL! Can I take pictures?!"

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "*buzzing indignantly* This is NOT a spectator sport, you uncultured clod! This is about MY rightful inheritance! I polished her lily pads! I organized her collection of moss! I pretended her poetry was good!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "...that... the... Duchess... left... her... entire... fortune..."

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "OOH OOH, let me guess! To the bee, right? Because of all that lily pad polishing? That's gotta count for something!"

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "OBVIOUSLY to me! Who ELSE would she leave it to? I was her ONLY companion in this godforsaken bog!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "...to... whoever... can... successfully... navigate... the... Swamp... of... Eternal... Inconvenience..."

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "*wings drooping* The WHAT now?"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "THE SWAMP OF ETERNAL INCONVENIENCE! Oh man, I've heard about this place! It's like, everything is just slightly annoying all the time!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "...within... twenty-four... hours. The... bee... must... compete... against... any... other... claimants..."

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "*suddenly appearing* DID SOMEONE SAY INHERITANCE CHALLENGE?!"

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "WHO IN THE NAME OF REFINED SOCIETY ARE YOU?!"

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "I'm Gerald, the Duchess's third cousin twice removed! I'm here to claim what's MINE!"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "This is getting SPICY! We've got DRAMA! We've got COMPETITION! We've got a snail who talks like he's buffering!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "...I... have... excellent... internet... actually..."

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "You absolute CHARLATAN, Gerald! You visited the Duchess ONCE, and you ate all her fancy algae appetizers!"

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "They were DELICIOUS and I have NO REGRETS! Now, where's this swamp we have to navigate?"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "*pointing* Oh, you're standing in it! The Swamp of Eternal Inconvenience is... well, it's just this swamp, but everything goes wrong in small, annoying ways!"

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "That's preposterous! I've lived here for decades! How hard could it possibly—"

*Bee's monocle immediately falls into murky water*

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "...be."

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "*confidently hopping forward* HAH! I've got this! Frogs are MADE for swamps! Watch me— *gets tangled in a hanging vine that's just at head height*"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "Oh no! The Inconvenience has begun! This is AMAZING! Should I be taking notes?"

BRAVE SNAIL: "*still holding documents* ...the... rules... state... that... inconveniences... will... multiply..."

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "*attempting to fly but keep getting caught in spiderwebs* This is BENEATH me! I am a PROFESSIONAL! I once served tea during a hurricane!"

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "*stuck in vine* Little help here?!"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "I mean, I COULD help, but I'm technically a witness, and also this is hilarious. Your left leg is also in a different vine now."

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "*finally free, covered in web* Ugh! And now my stripes are asymmetrical! This is a NIGHTMARE!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "...the... first... one... to... reach... the... Duchess's... memorial... gazebo... wins..."

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "Wait, where's the gazebo?"

BRAVE SNAIL: "*pointing very slowly in the distance* ...there..."

HOITY-TOITY BEE AND MYSTERIOUS FROG: "*squinting* "WHERE?!"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "Oh! I see it! It's like... really far. And there's a bunch of mud puddles between here and there that look like they're EXACTLY the wrong depth to walk through comfortably!"

HOITY-TOITY BEE: "*straightening up with dignity* Very well. I may be a bee of refined tastes, but I shall persevere through this indignity. For the Duchess. And for that sweet, sweet inheritance money."

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "*finally untangled* You're going DOWN, bee! I didn't drive four hours through traffic for nothing!"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "Oh man, four hours? Did you take the highway?"

MYSTERIOUS FROG: "Yes, and there was construction the ENTIRE way! Lane closures! Detours! Someone spilled a truck full of tennis balls!"

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "The inconvenience has been following you the WHOLE TIME! Gerald, you're CURSED!"

BRAVE SNAIL: "...on... your... marks... get... set..."

*Everyone waits*

BRAVE SNAIL: "...go."

*Bee immediately flies into a low-hanging branch. Frog hops into a puddle that's somehow both too shallow and too deep. Armadillo cheers enthusiastically.*

EXCITED ARMADILLO: "This is the BEST will reading EVER!"
