# Today's Improv (2026-01-05)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 23**

A brave komodo dragon, a vampire grasshopper, and a wise troll try to fit into a different era at a volcano

---

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "Okay team, we've traveled back to 1823. The key to blending in is confidence. Act natural."

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Natural? I'm a GRASSHOPPER. Who DRINKS BLOOD. In what era is that natural?!"

WISE TROLL: "The young grasshopper raises a valid concern. Perhaps we should have chosen a different landing site than an active volcano."

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "This volcano won't erupt for another 200 years. I checked the timeline. We're fine."

VOLCANO: *rumbles ominously*

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Did you hear that?! Did the VOLCANO just respond to you?!"

WISE TROLL: "In my 847 years of wisdom, I have learned that volcanoes do not typically take scheduling suggestions."

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "Focus! There's someone coming. Remember: act period-appropriate!"

19TH CENTURY GENTLEMAN: "Good heavens! What manner of creatures are you?"

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Uhhhh... we're... very progressive for our time?"

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "We're traveling salesmen! Yes! We sell... rocks. From this volcano. Very collectible."

19TH CENTURY GENTLEMAN: "A lizard, an insect, and a troll? Walking upright? Speaking English?"

WISE TROLL: "Technically, Old English evolved from—"

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "NOT HELPING!"

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Sir, I must ask—what's your blood type? I mean... FLOOD type? Like, are you prone to flooding? We also sell... flood insurance."

19TH CENTURY GENTLEMAN: "I'm leaving before I lose my sanity."

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "That went well! We totally fit in!"

WISE TROLL: "By what metric are you measuring success? He literally fled in terror."

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "I'm STARVING. Do they have blood banks in 1823?"

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "Banks yes, blood banks no. That's like 100 years away."

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO FOR 100 YEARS?!"

WISE TROLL: "I warned you all that time travel during your feeding schedule was inadvisable."

VOLCANO: *rumbles louder*

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "Okay, that's definitely getting louder."

WISE TROLL: "Perhaps your 'timeline check' was performed in Celsius when it should have been Fahrenheit."

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "That's not how timelines work!"

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Are we about to die in the past?! I haven't even been born yet! How does that work?!"

WISE TROLL: "The philosophical implications are quite fascinating, actually—"

VOLCANO: *ERUPTS*

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "TIME JUMP! NOW!"

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Where's the remote?! WHO HAD THE TIME REMOTE?!"

WISE TROLL: "I believe you had it last, as you were using it to take 'historical selfies.'"

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "FOUND IT! Everybody grab on!"

*WHOOSH*

VAMPIRE GRASSHOPPER: "Where are we now?!"

BRAVE KOMODO DRAGON: "Uhh... 2156. In a volcano museum. Oh good, this one's extinct."

TOUR GUIDE: "And behind this glass, you'll see preserved remains from the 1823 eruption—wait, are you OUTSIDE the exhibit?!"

WISE TROLL: "I did try to suggest that time travel was ill-advised."
