# Today's Improv (2026-02-17)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 66**

A self-sabotaging oak tree and a theatrical komodo dragon navigate return policies after property damage in the Arctic.

---

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Welcome to Arctic Gift Returns, how can I— oh no, it's you again."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "BEHOLD! I, Ignatius the Magnificent, have RETURNED to return this DEFECTIVE gift wrap that CRUMBLED beneath the heat of my PASSION!"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Sir, you burned down the entire store. The gift wrap worked fine. You just... breathed fire on it."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "Semantics! The product FAILED to withstand dragon fire! This is clearly a DESIGN FLAW! I demand a FULL refund!"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Okay, I'll need to see your receipt."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "My... receipt?"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Yes. The small paper that proves you purchased— you know what, never mind, I'm sure I'm going to mess this up anyway. I always do."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "Ah yes, the receipt! It was a MAGNIFICENT piece of thermal paper! I kept it in a SAFE place!"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Let me guess. Inside the store?"

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "Inside the store that I may have... accidentally... DRAMATICALLY reduced to a SMOLDERING PILE OF CHAR AND REGRET!"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Right. So no receipt. Which means I can't process your return. Which means you're going to yell at me, I'm going to panic, and somehow I'll end up giving you a refund AND my employee discount. Classic me."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "But the store is ASH! Surely that changes the RULES OF ENGAGEMENT?"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Actually, no. Company policy is very clear: no receipt, no return. Even if—" *checks manual* "—the store has been 'consumed by dragon fire, acts of war, or apocalyptic events.'"

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "This is PREPOSTEROUS! I am a THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON! Do you know how many DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES I've performed? How many STANDING OVATIONS?"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "I'm sure you're very talented, but I literally watched you burn down our store last Tuesday. You were wrapping a birthday present for your nephew and got 'emotionally overwhelmed by the beauty of the bow.'"

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "It WAS a beautiful bow! The curl! The symmetry! It moved me to TEARS! And then... flames."

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "I should just give you the refund. I mean, who am I to enforce policies? I'm just a tree who somehow became a gift wrapper in the Arctic. That's already a mistake."

ENLIGHTENED ANT: *appears on the counter* "Attachment to material things causes suffering, my friends."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "AH! A WISE ANT! Perhaps THIS tiny philosopher can illuminate the INJUSTICE of bureaucracy!"

ENLIGHTENED ANT: "The receipt is an illusion. The store is an illusion. Your dragon fire revealed the impermanence of all things."

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Great, now there's a Buddhist ant. This is exactly the kind of chaos I attract."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "So you're saying I DESERVE the refund because I've achieved ENLIGHTENMENT through ARSON?"

ENLIGHTENED ANT: "I'm saying you deserve nothing and everything simultaneously. Also, you definitely don't get a refund without a receipt."

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Wait, the ant agrees with me?"

ENLIGHTENED ANT: "Company policy transcends the material plane. It's one of the few absolute truths."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "BETRAYED! By a PHILOSOPHICAL INSECT! This is the GREATEST tragedy since my one-dragon show about Hamlet was cancelled for 'excessive property damage!'"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Sir, I'm going to say something, and I'm probably going to regret it, but here goes: No. You don't get a refund. You burned down a store. Please leave."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "I... I'm... IMPRESSED! Such CONVICTION! Such BACKBONE! You're like a theatrical oak tree who's finally found their MOTIVATION!"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Wait, really? I did it? I stood up for myself?"

ENLIGHTENED ANT: "This too shall pass."

THEATRICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "Very well! I shall ACCEPT this defeat with GRACE and DIGNITY! But mark my words— I shall return to this Arctic wasteland with PROPER DOCUMENTATION!"

SELF-SABOTAGING OAK TREE: "Great. Well, see you never, hopefully. Wait, I mean— ugh, I'm already undermining myself."

ENLIGHTENED ANT: "Baby steps, tree. Baby steps."
