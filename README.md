# Today's Improv (2026-02-25)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 74**

A nervous giraffe herald brings Ye Olde English tweet proclamations to a Robot Factory, where an elegant troll and a passive-aggressive angel make up the world's least enthusiastic audience

---

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: *unrolls a very long scroll* "Hear ye! Hear ye, denizens of yon Robot Factory! I am bidden to announce this day's tweets in the ancient tongue of our forebears!"

ELEGANT TROLL: "I'm sorry — the *tweets*?"

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "Oh, absolutely. Yes. This is fine. I'll just stand here and listen. It's fine."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "Tweet the first! Quoth the noble @GaryFromAccounting: 'Can't believe they took the good coffee machine out of the break room. Just... wow. Wow.' — Twenty-seven hearts and a gif of a weeping kitten."

ELEGANT TROLL: "I understood 'coffee' and nothing else."

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "It's really lovely that you're trying. Truly."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "Tweet the second! @TechDisruptorBro doth proclaim: 'Excited to announce that I am thrilled to begin a journey going forward, synergistically.' Three hundred hearts. Forty-two reposts."

ELEGANT TROLL: "What does any of that *mean*?"

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "He got a job. I went to heaven. We all have milestones."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: *voice cracking* "Tweet the third! @CryptoWizard88 doth declare: 'If thou art not thinking about Web4, thou art already Web2. Gm.' Fourteen hearts. One reply. It saith only: 'no.'"

ELEGANT TROLL: "What is Web4?"

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "Something that doesn't exist yet, but feel bad about it anyway."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "Tweet the fourth — 'tis a thread of many parts. @SentientRoomba doth begin: 'Okay, I need to talk about something. A THREAD.'"

ELEGANT TROLL: "Oh no."

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "Oh no."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "There are forty-seven parts."

ELEGANT TROLL: "Summarize. Please."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "I — the herald's oath forbids—"

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "We'll pretend we read it. We always pretend we read threads. This is a safe space."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: *sweating visibly* "Fine. Forty-seven parts. It is about cereal. Specifically, whether cereal is a soup. There is a strong conclusion."

ELEGANT TROLL: "What is the conclusion."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "It's a soup."

ELEGANT TROLL: *long pause* "I'm going back to my bridge."

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "Oh, please stay. I'll have to suffer alone if you go and I would so love company for that."

ROBOT FACTORY PA SYSTEM: "Attention. The 3:00 PM Ye Olde Tweet Announcement has exceeded its allotted time slot. Please wrap up."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "I've done *four*."

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: "...Is there a side exit?"

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: "I have translated the day's viral cat video into Middle English couplets. I worked on the rhymes for three days."

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ANGEL: *very long silence* "...Just the cat video. For the rhymes."

NERVOUS GIRAFFE: *brightening immediately* "Hark! A small beast doth leap and most grievously miss the table—"
