**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 19**

An enlightened bacteria and a hypochondriac hedgehog are at home when a ghost learns the truth in the astral plane

---

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "Ah, welcome to the astral plane, lost spirit. I sense you seek enlightenment."

GHOST: "I... I died? But HOW? I need to know!"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Oh great, a ghost. Are ghosts contagious? Can I catch being dead?"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "You cannot catch death, friend. You ARE death."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "WHAT?! Since when?!"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "Since 1987. You've been dead for 39 years."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "That explains the cold sweats! And the floating! I thought it was vertigo!"

GHOST: "Wait, I need answers about MY death! This is MY spiritual journey!"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Did I get it from you? Is this why I always feel weird at home?"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "The truth you seek, ghost, is simple: you choked on a pretzel."

GHOST: "A... a pretzel?"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "A pretzel. Very existential. Very cosmic. Very salty."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "Are pretzels safe? Should I avoid bread? I've been eating toast for 39 GHOST YEARS!"

GHOST: "That's it?! I've been wandering the astral plane for MONTHS because of a SNACK?!"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "All existence is snacks, when you think about it. We are but crumbs in the universe's couch."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "I'm scheduling an appointment with a spiritual doctor. Do those exist?"

GHOST: "This is ridiculous! I demand a more meaningful death! A hero's death!"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "You died doing what you loved. Eating alone on a couch watching game shows."

GHOST: "I KNEW I should have chewed more carefully!"

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "I knew I should have checked if I was ALIVE more carefully!"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "To be fair, being a bacteria, I exist in a constant state of cellular division and death. Very liberating."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "That sounds AWFUL. How do you deal with the anxiety?!"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "I simply... let go. Accept the void. Become one with—"

GHOST: "Can I get a second opinion? From a different astral guide? Maybe one with better news?"

ENLIGHTENED BACTERIA: "There is no other guide. There is only me. I am legion. Literally billions of me."

HYPOCHONDRIAC HEDGEHOG: "That's DEFINITELY contagious."
