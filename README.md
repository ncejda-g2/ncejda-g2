*The IAU is sad to announce that at 00:39 UTC on December 22nd, Jupiter and Saturn did unfortunately come into contact, and appear to have blooped together.*

### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** A cheerful hedgehog astronomer excitedly wakes up a sleepy penguin at the observatory. "Quick! Jupiter and Saturn are about to collide and 'bloop' together!" The penguin yawns, "That's not how physics works..."

**Panel 2:** They watch through the telescope as the planets appear to merge into one giant cosmic blob. The sleepy penguin rubs its eyes in disbelief while the hedgehog bounces with joy. "I TOLD YOU! They blooped!"

**Panel 3:** The next morning, they receive an apologetic email from NASA: "Sorry, intern Kevin left a jelly donut on the Hubble telescope lens. Jupiter and Saturn are fine. Please stop filing paperwork to rename them 'Jupiturn.'"
