**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 28**

A pretentious man works as a sommelier pairing wines with emotions at a therapy retreat aboard a pirate ship

---

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Welcome, everyone, to what I can only describe as the most *audacious* fusion of my talents. A therapy retreat... on a pirate ship... where I, Sebastian Worthington III, shall pair wines with your *feelings*."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Now, I studied at the Sorbonne, summered in Bordeaux, and have a palate so refined I can detect a grape's *childhood trauma*. So this should be... beneath me, really."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: *swirls glass* "Let's begin. Margaret, you're feeling... *anxious*? How pedestrian. For anxiety, I recommend this 2015 Pinot Grigio. Light, flighty, lacks commitment—much like your ability to make decisions, I'd imagine."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "What's that? The ship is rocking and you're getting seasick? Well, that's just adding *layers* to your anxiety, isn't it? Delightful complexity."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Todd, you say you're feeling *angry*? Ah yes, I can see it in your clenched fists and throbbing forehead vein. Charming. For rage, I suggest this Cabernet Sauvignon—bold, aggressive, leaves a bitter aftertaste. Sound familiar?"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "No, Todd, I cannot pair your anger with rum. This is a PIRATE SHIP, not a PIRATE STEREOTYPING CONVENTION. We have *standards*."

PARROT: *squawks from rigging* "STANDARDS! STANDARDS!"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Even the parrot understands. Thank you, Beauregard."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Now, Linda, you're experiencing *grief*. Oh, how terribly... *authentic*. For grief, nothing pairs quite like a Malbec—dark, brooding, makes you contemplate the void. It's practically a therapy session in a bottle."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Although, between you and me, I find grief rather... *gauche*. Have you considered feeling something more sophisticated? Perhaps *ennui*? I have a lovely Chablis for that."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "What's that, Captain? We're being boarded by rival pirates? During my TASTING SESSION?!"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Well, this is just... I mean, the *audacity*! I'm in the middle of pairing a Riesling with someone's abandonment issues!"

PIRATE: *bursts in* "SURRENDER YER BOOTY!"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "First of all, it's 'your,' not 'yer.' Second, I'm detecting notes of unresolved anger and possible daddy issues. Have you considered a nice Tempranillo?"

PIRATE: "What?"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Your energy is very *Tempranillo*. Robust, Spanish, slightly violent. I could do a full emotional wine pairing for you right now—do you have childhood trauma? Of course you do, you're a PIRATE."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "This is what I'm reduced to. I once consulted for Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris. Now I'm wine-profiling maritime criminals on a vessel that smells distinctly of fish and broken dreams."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "You know what? Everyone gets Chardonnay. EVERYTHING gets Chardonnay. Anxiety? Chardonnay. Rage? Chardonnay. Pirate invasion? CHARDONNAY."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "It's oaky, it's basic, it pairs with literally everything because it has NO BACKBONE—much like this entire therapeutic concept!"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: *takes long sip* "And now I'm drinking directly from the bottle. Do you see what you've done? You've reduced me to THIS. I'm a MONSTER."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Actually, wait. This emotional breakdown I'm having? It pairs beautifully with this Chardonnay. Notes of desperation with a finish of existential crisis. *Chef's kiss.*"

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "Perhaps I've learned something today. Perhaps the real wine pairing... was the trauma we experienced along the way."

PRETENTIOUS MAN: "No. No, that's stupid. The real lesson is that I need to update my LinkedIn. 'Pirate ship sommelier' does NOT look good on a CV."
