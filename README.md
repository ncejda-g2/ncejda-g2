A rockstar giraffe interviews for an absurd position in a futuristic city

---

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "So let me get this straight—you want me to be your company's Chief Vertical Integration Officer?"

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "*adjusts sunglasses* Look, I appreciate the irony. I'm seventeen feet tall. Very funny."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "But what does this position even DO? The job description just said 'reach things' and 'provide shade.'"

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "*reading holographic resume* It says here I need 'experience in elevated thinking.' Buddy, EVERYTHING I think is elevated. My brain is literally in the clouds."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "Oh, and apparently I need to 'interface with upper management.' I hate to break it to you, but I'm ALWAYS interfacing with upper management. Ceiling tiles are my mortal enemies."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "*leans back, hits head on ceiling* SEE?! This is my life! Your 'futuristic city' has the SAME low doorways as everywhere else!"

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "And another thing—your office is on the 47th floor, but the elevator only fits my legs. My head and neck have to take the STAIRS."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "Do you know what it's like riding an elevator when only your knees are inside? The other passengers just see legs. MYSTERIOUS LEGS. I've traumatized SO many people."

HOLOGRAPHIC RECEPTIONIST: "*flickering in* Mr. Giraffe, the interview panel is ready for you on floor 82."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "Floor EIGHTY-TWO?! *stands up dramatically* You know what? I don't need this gig. I'm a ROCKSTAR. I sold out the Serengeti!"

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "I've got MILLIONS of followers who watch me eat leaves off skyscrapers! I'm an INFLUENCER!"

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "*pauses* ...Wait, what's the salary?"

HOLOGRAPHIC RECEPTIONIST: "Four million credits annually, plus unlimited acacia leaf benefits."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "*immediately sits back down* ...I mean, I've always believed in the power of vertical integration. It's actually my PASSION."

ROCKSTAR GIRAFFE: "When do I start?"
