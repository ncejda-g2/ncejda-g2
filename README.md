# Today's Improv (2025-12-28)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 15**

A small imaginary friend, a nervous raccoon, and a theatrical E. coli are flight attendants caught in a lab accident at the beach

---

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Everyone stay calm! The lab chemicals spilled on the beach, but I'm sure it's fine—"

NERVOUS RACCOON: "FINE?! My tail is glowing neon green! I can taste colors! IS THAT NORMAL?!"

THEATRICAL E. COLI: "*strikes a dramatic pose* Behold! I have transcended my microscopic existence! Finally, the world shall witness my GRANDEUR!"

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Sir, you're literally one cell. You're still invisible."

THEATRICAL E. COLI: "LIES! I am MAGNIFICENT! I can feel myself... MULTIPLYING! This is my BROADWAY DEBUT!"

NERVOUS RACCOON: "We were just supposed to serve peanuts on Flight 237! How did we end up at a beach laboratory?!"

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Well, technically, you wandered into the cargo hold and ate those 'experimental samples'—"

NERVOUS RACCOON: "They were labeled 'LUNCH'!"

THEATRICAL E. COLI: "*twirling* And I was merely hitchhiking on your unwashed paws, dear raccoon, when DESTINY called!"

BEACH SCIENTIST: "*running over with clipboard* Did anyone touch the unstable isotopes?!"

ALL THREE: "...Define 'touch.'"

BEACH SCIENTIST: "Oh no. Oh no no no. You're all exhibiting signs of Quantum Beach Syndrome!"

NERVOUS RACCOON: "IS THAT FATAL?! I KNEW IT! I always knew my anxiety would be validated!"

THEATRICAL E. COLI: "Quantum Beach Syndrome... *gasps* It sounds like a MUSICAL! Tell me there's SINGING!"

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Wait, if I'm imaginary and got hit by REAL chemicals, does that make me... really imaginary? Or imaginarily real?"

BEACH SCIENTIST: "This is unprecedented! A raccoon with bioluminescence, a bacterium with delusions of grandeur, and a... what even ARE you?"

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "I'm Timmy's friend from third grade. He stopped believing in me, so I got a job with Delta."

THEATRICAL E. COLI: "*to scientist* You there! Do you have an agent? I require REPRESENTATION for my one-cell show!"

NERVOUS RACCOON: "*hyperventilating into paper bag* Can we just go back to the plane? I miss complaining about passengers!"

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "Look on the bright side—at least now when passengers ask 'What's in the water?' we'll have a really interesting answer."

BEACH SCIENTIST: "The effects should wear off in 72 hours. Probably. Maybe. Actually, I have no idea."

NERVOUS RACCOON: "THAT'S NOT COMFORTING!"

THEATRICAL E. COLI: "*dramatically* Seventy-two hours?! That's THREE DAYS of PERFORMANCE TIME! *begins singing* MEMORIES... LIKE THE CULTURE OF MY MIND..."

SMALL IMAGINARY FRIEND: "*sighs* And people wonder why nobody believes in imaginary friends anymore."
