# Today's Improv (2026-02-24)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 73**

A grumpy pangolin librarian and a pessimistic wasp Viking face the math of a thousand years of overdue fines in the gleaming halls of a Futuristic City hyper-library

---

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "Welcome to the Neo-Alexandria Hyper-Library. How can I efficiently ruin your morning?"

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "I have returned. A thousand years in enchanted slumber, and I knew — I *knew* — something would be wrong. It was going to be this."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "Name?"

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "Bjorn the Unending. Though perhaps Bjorn the Deeply Regretful would have been more accurate."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: *types into a holographic keyboard with aggressive precision* "Bjorn... Bjorn... oh. Oh, that's not good."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "Say the number."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "You checked out fourteen books in the year 1026. They were due fourteen days later. The standard late fee is point-one credits per book per day."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "And I have been asleep for approximately three hundred and sixty-five thousand days. So."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "So your total outstanding balance is... five hundred and eleven billion credits."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "I said to myself, as I closed my eyes in that mead hall, 'Bjorn, something will go catastrophically wrong while you sleep.' And here we are."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "There is also the matter of the books themselves."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "Gone."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "Gone *how*."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "We burned most things in 1026. It was a whole thing."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "You BURNED LIBRARY BOOKS."

MACHIAVELLIAN LLARVE: *sliding out from behind the Philosophy hologram stacks* "Excuse the intrusion. I couldn't help but overhear. I specialize in late fee... restructuring. For a modest forty percent commission, I can negotiate this down significantly."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "To what?"

MACHIAVELLIAN LLARVE: "Five hundred and ten billion, nine hundred million. Give or take."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "That's barely anything off."

MACHIAVELLIAN LLARVE: "Billion. With a B. I work fast."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "We don't negotiate. We do, however, offer a Millennium Amnesty Program. Two hundred hours of community service, debt wiped clean."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "Doing what, exactly."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "Story time. Tuesdays at eleven. The children love Norse mythology. Apparently."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: *very long pause* "I knew the moment I woke up it would end with me reading to children in a glowing building."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "Did you at least read *any* of the fourteen books before burning the rest?"

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "Three. The one about the dragon. The one about the other dragon. And the beginner's guide to returning library books on time, which I found deeply unhelpful."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: *puts head on hovering desk*

MACHIAVELLIAN LLARVE: "I'll take fifteen percent just for witnessing this."

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "Deal." *without lifting head*

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "Do you at least have dragon books for the children?"

GRUMPY PANGOLIN: "You burned them."

PESSIMISTIC WASP: "...Of course I did. See you Tuesday."
