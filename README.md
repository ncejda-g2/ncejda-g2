A samurai sloth and a sanctimonious chimpanzee help a ghost learn the truth in the astral plane at the beach

---

SAMURAI SLOTH: "Welcome to the astral plane, Lost Spirit. Your journey to enlightenment begins... very... slowly."

GHOST: "Wait, why is the astral plane just a regular beach? I expected floating crystals and cosmic wisdom!"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "That's EXACTLY the kind of materialistic thinking that trapped you in the cycle of death and rebirth! I've been astral projecting since 2003, and I can tell you're a BEGINNER."

SAMURAI SLOTH: "Patience. The truth reveals itself... when it is... ready."

GHOST: "How long does that take?"

SAMURAI SLOTH: "Three... to... five... business... days."

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "Back in MY first astral plane experience, I achieved nirvana in six minutes. But of course, not everyone has my spiritual aptitude."

GHOST: "I just want to know why I died! I was eating a burrito and then suddenly I'm here!"

SAMURAI SLOTH: "The burrito... was a metaphor."

GHOST: "For what?!"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "For your CHOICES! Everything is a metaphor if you're spiritually evolved enough. That's chapter three of my e-book, 'Chimps Can't Jump But Souls Can Soar.'"

GHOST: "You wrote an e-book in the astral plane?"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "Twelve e-books, actually. And a podcast. Some of us take the afterlife SERIOUSLY."

SAMURAI SLOTH: "The truth is... you were... lactose... intolerant."

GHOST: "THAT'S the cosmic truth?! I died from dairy?!"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "See, this is why I only consume organic, ethically-sourced astral energy. But some souls just refuse to do the work."

GHOST: "You're telling me I've been wandering between dimensions for three weeks because of CHEESE?!"

SAMURAI SLOTH: "The universe... has a sense... of humor."

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "If you had attended my webinar 'Manifesting Your Best Ghost Life,' you would have known to check for allergens before incarnating into a body."

GHOST: "I want a refund on this enlightenment experience!"

SAMURAI SLOTH: "All sales... are final... in eternity."

RANDOM BEACH SEAGULL: *flies through ghost* "CAW CAW!"

GHOST: "Did that seagull just fly through my ethereal form?!"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "That seagull has achieved a higher consciousness than you. Notice how it doesn't question the burrito? It simply ACCEPTS the burrito."

SAMURAI SLOTH: "The seagull... is wise."

GHOST: "I'm getting spiritual life lessons from a SEAGULL?!"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "This is exactly the ego-death I talk about in my TED Talk. Which I gave. In the astral plane. To an audience of enlightened beings."

SAMURAI SLOTH: "That was... a TED... Talk? I thought... it was... naptime."

GHOST: "You know what? I'm going back to haunt my apartment. At least there I understood the rules!"

SANCTIMONIOUS CHIMPANZEE: "Typical. Running away from growth. I'll add this to my case study on resistant spirits."

SAMURAI SLOTH: "May your haunting... be... peaceful."
