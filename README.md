### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** Content Owl sits at her desk with noise-canceling headphones, working peacefully on spreadsheets. Clumsy Chicken bursts into the office, knocking over three coffee mugs while yelling: "GUYS! I found a productivity hack—if we play death metal at 100 decibels, we'll work FASTER!" Nervous Dragon covers his ears: "I... I can already hear my stress levels rising and you haven't even started the music yet."

**Panel 2:** Clumsy Chicken plugs in massive speakers and cranks the volume. The office shakes. Content Owl's headphones fly off from the sheer bass vibrations. She calmly opens her laptop settings and reveals a custom app: "Office Noise Filter - Current Level: 98dB." She adjusts the slider to "60dB or less" and clicks "Find Quiet Conference Room." Nervous Dragon whispers: "There's an app for that?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!"

**Panel 3:** Content Owl and Nervous Dragon are now peacefully working in a silent library-like conference room. Clumsy Chicken finds them and crashes through the door: "THERE you are! Why'd you leave? I turned it up to 110dB like a REAL office should—" Content Owl slowly slides the noise filter to "40dB" and presses a big red button labeled "EJECTOR SEAT." Clumsy Chicken is immediately catapulted back to the loud office. Nervous Dragon, finally relaxed: "This button should automatically appear when you reach your 30th performance review."
