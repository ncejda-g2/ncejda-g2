# Today's Improv (2026-02-09)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 58**

A gourmet spider works as a professional gift wrapper explaining receipt policies to a dragon who burned down the store in Candyland

GOURMET SPIDER: "Sir, I understand your frustration, but corporate policy is VERY clear—no receipt, no return."

GOURMET SPIDER: "Yes, I can SEE that you've incinerated the entire store. The scent of caramelized gingerbread is quite... aromatic, actually. Notes of burnt sugar, hints of dragon bile."

GOURMET SPIDER: "Magnificent sear on those lollipop trees. But that doesn't change our return policy."

DRAGON: *distant roar*

GOURMET SPIDER: "Yelling won't help! I've wrapped gifts for ROYALTY. I once gift-wrapped a live octopus for the Peppermint King. Do you think HE had a receipt? He did! Because he's RESPONSIBLE."

GOURMET SPIDER: "Look at this wrapping paper you want to return—it's GORGEOUS. Holographic candy canes, embossed with edible glitter. I selected this myself! And you torched it!"

GOURMET SPIDER: "The artistry! The presentation! Reduced to ASH because you couldn't control your TEMPER when they said we were out of curling ribbon!"

DRAGON: *sheepish rumble*

GOURMET SPIDER: "Oh NOW you're sorry? The entire Gumdrop District is GONE! Do you know how long it takes to cultivate artisanal gumdrops?"

GOURMET SPIDER: "I've spun silk bows for CENTURIES. Each one a masterpiece. Each one perfectly balanced between elegance and whimsy. And this is how you treat my craft?"

GOURMET SPIDER: "Without that receipt, I literally CANNOT process your return. The computer system runs on receipt numbers. The computer system that is now MOLTEN CANDY."

GOURMET SPIDER: "You want a refund? Fine. Let me just check with my manager—OH WAIT. My manager is currently crystallized in a coating of flash-heated sugar glass."

GOURMET SPIDER: "You know what? Keep the wrapping paper. Consider it a souvenir. A reminder of the day you learned that receipts exist for a REASON."

DRAGON: *apologetic whimper, offers handful of gold coins*

GOURMET SPIDER: "Gold? You think you can BUY your way out of this? *pauses* ...Actually, how much gold are we talking?"

GOURMET SPIDER: "That IS a considerable amount. Enough to rebuild the store. Perhaps even upgrade to that premium metallic tissue paper I've been eyeing..."

GOURMET SPIDER: "You know what, sir? I'm going to make an EXCEPTION. Just this once. Corporate can invoice the insurance for 'Acts of Dragon.'"

GOURMET SPIDER: "But next time? KEEP. YOUR. RECEIPT."

GOURMET SPIDER: "Now if you'll excuse me, I need to wrap this pile of gold before the marshmallow rain starts. The humidity absolutely RUINS my corners."
