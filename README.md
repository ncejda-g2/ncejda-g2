# Today's Improv (2026-02-11)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 60**

A chaotic sentient broccoli, a down-to-earth grasshopper, and a backstabbing woman must teach a trust fall workshop at a corporate retreat in a haunted house

---

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "Alright corporate drones, welcome to Trust Fall 101! I'm your instructor, and YES, the room is spinning because the walls are bleeding. That's just Big Pharma trying to distract you from FALLING BACKWARDS!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GRASSHOPPER: "Actually, we're in a haunted house. The walls are literally bleeding. Maybe we should've booked the Holiday Inn conference room instead."

BACKSTABBING WOMAN: "Oh sure, Broccoli gets to lead the workshop even though I have THREE certifications in team building. But no one listens to Karen from HR."

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "Trust falls are a GOVERNMENT PSYOP to make you vulnerable! But we're going to RECLAIM them! Now, who wants to go first?"

EMPLOYEE #1: "I'm not falling backwards in a haunted house with vegetables giving orders!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GRASSHOPPER: "Look, I understand your concern, but trust exercises are actually proven to—wait, is that portrait's eyes following us?"

BACKSTABBING WOMAN: "They hired ME to do this workshop, you know. But then Broccoli showed up with their 'alternative methodology' and suddenly I'm demoted to 'assistant facilitator.'"

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "Karen, you're PROJECTING! This is exactly why no one trusts you at the company picnic! Now, everyone pair up! When you fall, your partner will catch you—UNLESS they're part of the shadow government!"

EMPLOYEE #1: "How do we know if our partner is part of the shadow government?!"

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "Excellent question! Check their shoes. If they're too shiny, they're DEFINITELY compromised."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GRASSHOPPER: "Nobody here is compromised. We work in dental insurance. Can we please just do a normal trust fall?"

BACKSTABBING WOMAN: "I'll partner with you, Grasshopper. At least YOU appreciate proper workshop etiquette."

*Ghost appears behind them*

GHOST: "OooOOOoooOOOooo!"

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "SEE?! The spirits are WARNING us! They're trying to tell us about the fluoride in the water supply!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GRASSHOPPER: "That's just Gary. He's the house ghost. He does this every Tuesday."

BACKSTABBING WOMAN: "Okay, Grasshopper, I'm going to fall now. You'll catch me, right? Unlike SOME people who steal workshop opportunities."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GRASSHOPPER: "Yes, I'll catch—"

BACKSTABBING WOMAN: *falls backwards*

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: *tackles Grasshopper* "WAIT! I need to check if Grasshopper's antenna are receiving signals from THEM!"

*Backstabbing Woman hits the floor*

BACKSTABBING WOMAN: "I KNEW IT! No one in this company values trust OR my contributions!"

EMPLOYEE #1: "I'm transferring to the non-haunted branch."

CHAOTIC SENTIENT BROCCOLI: "This is going PERFECTLY! You've all learned that trust is an ILLUSION perpetuated by the matrix!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GRASSHOPPER: "We're banned from corporate retreats, aren't we?"

GARY THE GHOST: "OooOooh yeah, you definitely are."
