# Today's Improv (2026-02-01)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 50**

A content woman interrogates an arrogant otter who only communicates through interpretive dance on a mountain

---

CONTENT WOMAN: "Alright, let's make this simple. Where were you on the night of January 30th?"

ARROGANT OTTER: *performs an elaborate pirouette, then mimes climbing stairs*

CONTENT WOMAN: "I'm going to need you to use actual words."

ARROGANT OTTER: *shakes head vigorously, does jazz hands*

CONTENT WOMAN: "Sir, this is a murder investigation, not 'So You Think You Can Dance.'"

ARROGANT OTTER: *strikes a dramatic pose, pretends to weep*

CONTENT WOMAN: "Are you... crying? Or is that part of the dance?"

ARROGANT OTTER: *spins three times, points at own chest proudly, then moonwalks backward*

CONTENT WOMAN: "Okay, so you were... moonwalking away from the crime scene? That's what you're telling me?"

ARROGANT OTTER: *frantically waves arms, performs what appears to be the robot*

CONTENT WOMAN: "Why are we doing this on a MOUNTAIN? The precinct has a perfectly good interrogation room!"

SLEEPY OTTER: *shuffles past carrying camping gear* "Budget cuts. Also, I thought this was the yoga retreat."

CONTENT WOMAN: "This is EXACTLY why I transferred from vice. At least the drug dealers would TALK to me."

ARROGANT OTTER: *does the worm across the rocky ground, then stands up and dusts self off with exaggerated dignity*

CONTENT WOMAN: "You know what? Fine. If you want to dance, we'll dance. Was the victim PUSHED?" *does a pushing motion*

ARROGANT OTTER: *gasps theatrically, clutches pearls that don't exist, then does a grand jeté*

CONTENT WOMAN: "A grand jeté means yes?"

ARROGANT OTTER: *taps nose smugly, then vogues*

CONTENT WOMAN: "And the vogue means you're fabulous?"

ARROGANT OTTER: *nods enthusiastically, continues voguing*

CONTENT WOMAN: "I've been a detective for fifteen years. FIFTEEN. I've interrogated mob bosses, serial killers, and one guy who thought he was a toaster. But THIS—" *gestures wildly* "—THIS is my breaking point!"

ARROGANT OTTER: *performs interpretive dance depicting a woman having an existential crisis*

CONTENT WOMAN: "Are you MOCKING me right now?!"

ARROGANT OTTER: *smirks, then does the floss*

CONTENT WOMAN: "You know what? You're under arrest for obstruction of justice and crimes against choreography."

ARROGANT OTTER: *breakdances in protest*

SLEEPY OTTER: *yawning from nearby* "Anyone want s'mores? I brought marshmallows."
