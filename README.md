# Today's Improv (2026-02-02)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 51**

A nerdy ant princess inherits a haunted castle in the city, but a delusional venus fly trap ghost agrees to leave if the princess fulfills their last remaining earthly wish

---

NERDY ANT: "Okay, so according to my research, you've been haunting this castle for 200 years. That's... technically impressive from a thermodynamic perspective."

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "Two hundred years of GLORY! I was the most famous botanist in the realm! They called me the Plant Whisperer!"

NERDY ANT: "The historical records say you were a hedge trimmer who died after eating questionable mushrooms."

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "LIES! Propaganda from Big Gardening! Now, fulfill my last wish and I shall depart this mortal coil... again."

NERDY ANT: *adjusts tiny glasses* "Right. What's the wish?"

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "I need you to water me."

NERDY ANT: "That's... surprisingly reasonable?"

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "With the tears of a accountant who just realized they love their job."

NERDY ANT: "There it is."

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "Also the accountant must be named Gerald. And they must be wearing plaid."

NERDY ANT: "Do you have ANY idea how specific that is? This is a city! There are like eight Geralds and the probability that one of them is both an accountant AND experiencing a career epiphany while wearing plaid—"

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: *floating menacingly* "Did I mention the castle is in escrow and closes in 48 hours?"

NERDY ANT: "You're holding my real estate transaction hostage?!"

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: *bursts through door in full suit* "SOMEBODY CALL FOR A KOMODO DRAGON REALTOR?! I smell COMMISSION!"

NERDY ANT: "How did you even get in here?"

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "I have a SIXTH SENSE for desperate property deals! Also, the door was open."

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "NO REALTORS! Only Gerald! GERALD IN PLAID!"

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "Ma'am, I'll have you know I wore plaid once in 1987. Does that count?"

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "Are you an accountant named Gerald?"

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "I'm a komodo dragon named Steve."

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "Then NO."

NERDY ANT: "Wait. Steve, do you know any accountants named Gerald?"

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "I know a Gerald! He does my taxes! Loves his job, weird guy. Always wears plaid on Fridays!"

NERDY ANT: "IT'S SUNDAY."

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "Then we wait until Friday! Problem solved!"

NERDY ANT: "The escrow closes in 48 HOURS! That's Tuesday!"

DELUSIONAL VENUS FLY TRAP: "Should've thought of that before inheriting a haunted castle, shouldn't you?"

NERDY ANT: *frantically calculating on tiny calculator* "Okay, okay. Statistically speaking, if I can convince Gerald to wear plaid on a non-Friday AND trigger an emotional career breakthrough, accounting for standard deviation in human emotional responses..."

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "Or we could just call him? I have his number."

NERDY ANT: "...why didn't you lead with that?"

GRANDIOSE KOMODO DRAGON: "DRAMA! It's all about the PRESENTATION! That's what they taught us in komodo dragon real estate school!"
