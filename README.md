# Today's Improv (2026-01-24)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 42**

A backstabbing gorilla, a wizard moose, and a hypocritical komodo dragon inherit a haunted castle in the desert, where a ghost agrees to leave if they fulfill its last earthly wish

---

GHOST: "WHOOOOO... I shall depart this realm if you fulfill my final wish..."

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "Great! What do you need? Money? Revenge? I can arrange both, with a small finders fee."

WIZARD MOOSE: "By the ancient magics, I sense this spirit seeks something pure! Perhaps... closure?"

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "Everyone needs to be honest here. No lies, no deception. That's my policy."

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "Didn't you literally scam us into coming here by saying this was a 'luxury resort'?"

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "That's completely different! I was being aspirationally honest."

GHOST: "My final wish is... I want someone to water my cactus."

WIZARD MOOSE: "A cactus? In the desert? How poetic! The cycle of life and—"

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "Wait, where's the cactus?"

GHOST: "In the conservatory. Third door on the left."

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "This seems suspiciously easy. I don't trust easy things."

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "You literally JUST said we need to be honest. The ghost is being straightforward!"

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "Yes, and I'm honestly suspicious! See? Honesty!"

WIZARD MOOSE: "I shall retrieve the sacred succulent!" *gallops off*

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "So... Ghost, once you leave, who gets the castle? Because I'm thinking we should discuss ownership percentages."

GHOST: "You all inherit it equally..."

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "Right, but I found this place FIRST—"

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "We all got the lawyer's letter at the same time!"

WIZARD MOOSE: *returns* "The cactus is... fifteen feet tall and has teeth."

GHOST: "Oh yes, that's Gerald. He bites."

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE BITING!"

GHOST: "You didn't ask."

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "Okay, new plan. Moose, you water it. You've got magic."

WIZARD MOOSE: "My magic is for noble purposes, not cactus husbandry!"

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "I'll give you 40% of the castle!"

WIZARD MOOSE: "I thought we split it equally?"

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "We DO. I'm offering you my future share of Komodo's portion."

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "You can't sell MY share!"

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "I'm not selling, I'm... pre-negotiating."

GHOST: "The cactus is getting thirsty..."

WIZARD MOOSE: "FINE! Aqueous magnificus!" *water sprays everywhere*

GERALD THE CACTUS: *demonic screeching*

GHOST: "Perfect! My work here is done. The castle is yours. Good luck with Gerald. He needs watering every day."

WIZARD MOOSE: "EVERY DAY?!"

GHOST: "Toodles!" *vanishes*

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "So... anyone want to buy my third of a haunted castle with a demon cactus?"

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "You can't just SELL it immediately! That's so dishonest!"

BACKSTABBING GORILLA: "You literally tried to sell it before we even got here!"

HYPOCRITICAL KOMODO DRAGON: "I was testing YOUR honesty!"

GERALD THE CACTUS: *aggressive rustling*

WIZARD MOOSE: "I'm going back to the forest. You two deserve each other."
