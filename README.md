### The Story
An upset owl posted on Craigslist: "You: friendly cat who winked at me on the subway. Me: majestic nocturnal bird trying to commute during daylight hours." A small giraffe responded: "That was me, I'm just really short and the lighting was bad." The owl flew to meet them, squinted, and said, "You know what, I can see it—you both have those little ear tufts."
