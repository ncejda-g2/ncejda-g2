**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 29**

A small chicken, working as a psychic in a medieval castle, adopts a baby and gets more than he bargained for

---

SMALL CHICKEN: "So, picture this. I'm a chicken. A SMALL chicken. And I'm running a psychic business out of the east tower of a medieval castle. Already absurd, right? Wait, it gets worse."

SMALL CHICKEN: "I see this baby at the orphanage—poor little thing, abandoned at the drawbridge. And I think, 'You know what? I'm psychic. I've got premonitions. I can handle ONE baby.'"

SMALL CHICKEN: "First red flag should've been when I had a vision of the baby and just saw... chaos. Pure, unfiltered chaos. But did I listen to my own psychic powers? NO. Because apparently I'm an IDIOT."

SMALL CHICKEN: "Day one: The baby starts levitating. LEVITATING. I'm a psychic chicken, I read fortunes with tarot cards I can barely shuffle with these wings, and THIS BABY IS FLOATING."

SMALL CHICKEN: "I'm trying to change a diaper while the child is doing loop-de-loops around the chandelier. Do you know how hard it is to catch a flying baby when you're THREE POUNDS?"

SMALL CHICKEN: "Day three: The baby turns the castle moat into grape juice. GRAPE JUICE. The knights are furious. The lord of the castle is demanding answers. I'm just standing there like, 'I... I don't know, my lord, perhaps it's a plumbing issue?'"

SMALL CHICKEN: "Then I have another vision—this baby? Not a baby. It's a DEMON. A powerful, ancient demon who got bored being evil and wanted to experience childhood."

SMALL CHICKEN: "I confronted the baby. I said, 'ARE YOU A DEMON?' And you know what this baby did? Smiled at me. SMILED. And then all the torches in the room turned blue."

SMALL CHICKEN: "So now I'm parenting a demon baby while running a psychic business and being, again, a SMALL CHICKEN. My daily routine is: wake up, peck some grain, divine the future, stop the baby from opening portals to the underworld, go to bed."

SMALL CHICKEN: "Yesterday, a knight came in for a tarot reading. He wanted to know if he'd win the tournament. Meanwhile, the baby is behind me JUGGLING FLAMING SKULLS like it's NO BIG DEAL."

SMALL CHICKEN: "I just laid out the cards real quick and said, 'You'll die honorably in battle, now PLEASE LEAVE.'"

SMALL CHICKEN: "The worst part? I saw ALL of this coming. I'm literally psychic. I saw the floating, the moat incident, the flaming skulls. I saw EVERYTHING."

SMALL CHICKEN: "But when I looked into the future, I also saw something else. I saw the baby—well, the demon—growing up. Learning. Laughing. Calling me 'Papa.'"

SMALL CHICKEN: "And I thought... maybe I can do this. Maybe a small psychic chicken CAN raise a demon baby in a medieval castle. Maybe—"

BABY: *from offscreen* "PAPA! PAPA! I TURNED THE GUARDS INTO FROGS!"

SMALL CHICKEN: "WHAT?! No! NO! We talked about this! You can't just—" *sighs deeply* "You know what? This is fine. This is my life now."

SMALL CHICKEN: "I'm going to add a new service to my psychic business: Demon Baby Management Consulting. Because if I survived this, ANYONE can learn from my mistakes."

SMALL CHICKEN: "First lesson: When you have a vision of chaos... LISTEN TO THE VISION. Don't adopt the chaos. Don't NAME the chaos. Don't teach the chaos to read."

SMALL CHICKEN: "Second lesson: Being three pounds does NOT stop you from being a parent. It just makes everything significantly harder and funnier for the castle guards to watch."

SMALL CHICKEN: "Third lesson: Love is weird, folks. Sometimes it's a small chicken and a demon baby in a medieval castle. And you know what? That's valid."

SMALL CHICKEN: "Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go un-frog some guards and explain to the lord why his throne room is now filled with butterflies that whisper ancient prophecies."

SMALL CHICKEN: "Being a parent is hard. Being a psychic is hard. Being a chicken is hard. Being ALL THREE? Well, at least I'll never run out of material for my memoirs."

SMALL CHICKEN: "'Clucks and Consequences: A Small Chicken's Guide to Raising the Antichrist.' It's gonna be a bestseller. I saw it in a vision."
