# Today's Improv (2026-01-13)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 31**

An upset oak tree, a sanctimonious angel, and a gregarious angel navigate a family dinner where everyone speaks in rhyme at an amusement park

---

UPSET OAK TREE: "I did not agree to this family affair, and frankly I'm rooted right here in despair."

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "Oh come on, dear Oak, it's a wonderful night! The carousel's spinning, the Ferris wheel's bright!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "We gather as kin, to dine and to pray, to honor the Lord in this righteous way."

UPSET OAK TREE: "You Honor the Lord? With corn dogs and fries? While children throw up on the Tilt-A-Whirl rides?"

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "The cotton candy's pink, the funnel cake's divine! Let's make happy memories, this family of mine!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "Remember our ancestors, noble and true, who broke bread with grace, not like you barbecue!"

UPSET OAK TREE: "I've been standing here for three hundred years, and this is BY FAR my worst dinner, I fear."

CARNIVAL BARKER: "Step right up folks, win a prize if you dare! Test your strength, ring the bell, show you care!"

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "Oh! Oh! Let's do that after we eat! It'll be so much fun, what a wonderful treat!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "Such frivolous games, such waste and such sin! True virtue comes from discipline within!"

UPSET OAK TREE: "You're both driving me nuts—and I mean that quite literal, I'm dropping acorns on your heads in a ritual!"

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "Dad, please don't be mad, we're here to connect! Let's ride the log flume, get completely wet!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "Our great-grandfather Oak never would have allowed, such debauchery here with this terrible crowd."

UPSET OAK TREE: "Great-grandfather Oak was burned down for firewood, so maybe his judgment wasn't that good!"

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "Can we please just get along for one single night? I brought board games to play under the light!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "Board games are fine if they teach moral lessons, not mindless amusement in multiple sessions."

UPSET OAK TREE: "I literally cannot leave, I have roots in the ground, so I'm stuck with you two and this terrible sound!"

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "Let's focus on gratitude, family, and cheer! I'm so glad we could all gather here!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "I suppose we should try, to make amends tonight, though this venue is garish and nothing seems right."

UPSET OAK TREE: "Fine. Pass me a churro, let's get this done quick, before some teenager carves their name in me with a stick."

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "That's the spirit! Now everyone smile! Let's take a selfie in authentic style!"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "A 'selfie' is vanity, a sin we must shun, but... I suppose just one photo might be... somewhat fun?"

UPSET OAK TREE: "Did you just break your sanctimonious streak? Is that a smile I see starting to peek?"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "Absolutely not! I maintain my position! ...But these funnel cakes ARE quite the tradition."

GREGARIOUS ANGEL: "Best family dinner EVER! I knew we could do it! Now let's ride the bumper cars—who's ready to go through it?"

UPSET OAK TREE: "I'm a tree. I literally cannot move from this spot. But you two go ahead, have fun, why not?"

SANCTIMONIOUS ANGEL: "I'll stay with Dad Oak, it's the righteous thing to do... And possibly eat his share of churros too."

UPSET OAK TREE: "At least you're honest about your gluttony. That's growth."
