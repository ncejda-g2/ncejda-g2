# Today's Improv (2025-12-21)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 8**

A geeky spider, a diligent woman, and an arrogant demon are trapped by a hurricane on a pirate ship

---

GEEKY SPIDER: "*adjusting tiny glasses on multiple eyes while clinging to rigging* According to my calculations, the hurricane's eye will pass over us in approximately 47 minutes! Also, I've been meaning to mention—I think we're cursed."

DILIGENT WOMAN: "*organizing barrels alphabetically while the ship rocks violently* Cursed? That would explain the checklist. I've crossed off 'bail water,' 'secure cargo,' and 'question life choices,' but there's a mysterious item here that just says 'break curse.' No instructions!"

ARROGANT DEMON: "*lounging on the captain's chair, completely unfazed* Of COURSE we're cursed. I cursed us. Three hours ago. You mortals really need to pay more attention."

GEEKY SPIDER: "YOU WHAT?! Why would you curse your own shipmates during a HURRICANE?!"

ARROGANT DEMON: "I was bored. Plus, you kept correcting my sea shanty lyrics. It's 'yo ho,' not 'yo HO,' apparently. Very passive-aggressive of you, spider."

DILIGENT WOMAN: "*still organizing* Okay, this is fine. I'll just add 'un-curse ourselves' to the to-do list. Right after 'survive storm' and before 'find dry clothes.' Can you uncurse us?"

ARROGANT DEMON: "I COULD, but where's the fun in that? The curse is that we can't leave the ship until someone admits they're wrong about something. Should be simple for lesser beings like yourselves."

GEEKY SPIDER: "*indignant* Excuse me? I am NEVER wrong! Do you know how many PhD dissertations I've peer-reviewed? Seventeen! All on maritime arachnid behavior!"

DILIGENT WOMAN: "I keep meticulous records. I've been right about everything since 2003. I have spreadsheets."

ARROGANT DEMON: "*grinning* And I'm a DEMON. We literally invented being right. This is going to take a while."

GEEKY SPIDER: "*as a wave crashes over the deck* Wait, wait! What if we're ALL wrong about something simultaneously? Would that break the curse through a logical paradox?"

ARROGANT DEMON: "That's... actually clever. I hate that you thought of it first."

DILIGENT WOMAN: "*pulling out waterproof notebook* I'll make a list of things we might be wrong about. Number one: perhaps organizing barrels during a hurricane isn't the MOST urgent task."

GEEKY SPIDER: "And maybe... just maybe... citing my sources during a life-threatening situation is slightly annoying."

ARROGANT DEMON: "*long pause* Fine. FINE! Perhaps cursing people during a natural disaster is... marginally irresponsible."

RANDOM PARROT: "*suddenly appearing on the mast* SQUAWK! YOU'RE ALL WRONG! THIS ISN'T EVEN A REAL PIRATE SHIP! IT'S A DINNER CRUISE! SQUAWK!"

GEEKY SPIDER: "...What."

DILIGENT WOMAN: "*checking her notes* Oh no. He's right. The itinerary says 'Caribbean Sunset Experience with Themed Entertainment.'"

ARROGANT DEMON: "So we've been arguing about a curse on a TOURIST ATTRACTION?!"

GEEKY SPIDER: "This is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me, and I once got trapped in someone's JavaScript framework documentation for three days."

DILIGENT WOMAN: "Does this mean we were all wrong about the fundamental nature of our situation?"

ARROGANT DEMON: "*sighs dramatically* Yes. The curse is broken. By a parrot. I'm going back to Hell. At least there, people take my curses SERIOUSLY."

RANDOM PARROT: "SQUAWK! THE BUFFET IS CLOSED! SQUAWK!"

GEEKY SPIDER: "Well, at least we learned something about humility today."

DILIGENT WOMAN: "*making notes* Adding 'verify ship authenticity' to my pre-boarding checklist."
