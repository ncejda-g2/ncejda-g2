# Today's Improv (2025-12-15)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 1**

An enlightened alien and a nerdy cat are teachers dealing with bizarre student excuses on an alien planet.

---

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "Class, please settle your seventeen eyestalks. Now, Zorbak, you said your homework was eaten by a what?"

NERDY CAT: "Actually, according to section 4.2 of the Student Handbook, 'consumed by interdimensional rift' is NOT on the approved excuse list."

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "Let us approach this with cosmic understanding. Zorbak, tell me—did this rift have proper documentation?"

NERDY CAT: "I cross-referenced the Galactic Excuse Database. Last week, three students claimed rifts ate their homework. All three rifts were actually just lockers they forgot the combination to."

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "Ah, but perhaps this is a teachable moment about the nature of reality itself. Zorbak, what color was this rift?"

NERDY CAT: "Color is irrelevant! The assignment was on quantum mathematics, which ironically EXPLAINS why interdimensional rifts can't selectively consume homework while leaving his lunch intact!"

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "My feline colleague makes a compelling point. Zorbak, your lunch is still in your bag."

NERDY CAT: "And it's still moving. Is that normal for your species?"

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "I sense Zorbak's aura radiating the frequency of... creative fiction. However, I appreciate the effort. The lie shows imagination."

NERDY CAT: "We're REWARDING dishonesty now? I didn't get my doctorate in Applied Mathematics to validate interdimensional excuse fraud!"

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "You got your doctorate from an online program on Earth, Gerald. I was there when you took the final exam during recess."

NERDY CAT: "It was ACCREDITED! And my name is Professor Gerald, thank you very much!"

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "Zorbak, here is your cosmic wisdom for today: the universe is vast and mysterious, but not mysterious enough to excuse poor time management. You have until tomorrow to redo the assignment."

NERDY CAT: "And if another rift 'eats' it, I'm assigning a five-page essay on the thermodynamics of interdimensional portals with citations!"

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "Gerald, that seems excessive—"

NERDY CAT: "You know what's excessive? I have students claiming their homework was abducted by humans for 'research.' WE'RE the ones who abducted THEM! The irony is maddening!"

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "Perhaps we both need to visit the meditation pods during lunch."

NERDY CAT: "I can't. There's a rift in the teacher's lounge. It ate my calming tea."

ENLIGHTENED ALIEN: "...now I understand why I chose enlightenment over retirement."
