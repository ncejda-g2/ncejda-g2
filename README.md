# Today's Improv (2026-02-06)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 55**

A theatrical giraffe, an excited hedgehog, and a bewildered unicorn have a family dinner where everyone speaks in rhyme in a Wizard's Tower

---

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "Welcome all to dinner's stage, where words must rhyme throughout the age!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "Wait... what? Rhyme? Since... when? I don't... understand this trend!"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "It's fun, it's great, let's celebrate! I brought some cheese upon my plate!"

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "How magnifique! Your contribution speaks! Now let us dine for several weeks!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "Weeks?! That's... meeks? No wait, that's cheeks? I'm bad at this... my brain just leaks!"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "You're doing fine, just drink some wine! Or water's good, or turpentine!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "Please don't make me drink turpentine! That can't be... wait, that actually does rhyme!"

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "BRAVO! You've found your inner poet! Your talent blooms, and now we know it!"

WIZARD'S TOWER BUTLER: *enters* "Excuse me, sirs, the soup is... hot. And also... got... Oh dear, I forgot."

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "The soup is HOT and hits the SPOT! Well done, good sir, that rhymes a LOT!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "This is exhausting, I can't think straight... my head is spinning, I ate too late!"

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "Nonsense, dear! You're doing great! Now pass the bread before I ate!"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "You mean 'before you ATE'? Too late! That tense is wrong, let's set that straight!"

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "How DARE you criticize my ART! I've been rhyming from the START!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "Can we just... stop? This hurts my head... I'd rather eat in silence, Fred."

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "My NAME'S not FRED, how DARE you, TED!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "I'm not Ted either! This rhyme thing messed with... reader? Cedar?"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "You said 'either'! That's so fun! Now everything's rhymed, we're almost done!"

WIZARD'S TOWER BUTLER: *returns* "The dessert's ready... if you please... it's chocolate mousse with... beans? Oh geez."

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "Beans?! With mousse?! What sort of crime! Is happening in this wizard's... chime?"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "The recipe said 'please add peas'! But I misread with such great ease!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "Wait, YOU made dinner? Oh no... oh my... I think I need to... say goodbye!"

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "We're trapped by rhyme! We cannot leave! Until this curse we can relieve!"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "What if we just... stop speaking, friends? Maybe that's how the rhyming ends?"

*long pause*

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "Did it work?"

THEATRICAL GIRAFFE: "I don't think so. The curse persists wherever we go!"

BEWILDERED UNICORN: "DAMMIT! I rhymed again with 'work' and 'so'!"

EXCITED HEDGEHOG: "This is the best family dinner I know!"
