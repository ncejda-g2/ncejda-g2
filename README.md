# Today's Improv (2026-01-18)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 36**

A vindictive penguin confronts office bureaucracy while a documentary crew narrates it like an action thriller

---

NARRATOR: "Day 47 of Operation Stapler Retrieval. Our hero enters the danger zone... also known as Floor 3."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "Karen from accounting took my stapler. AGAIN. She thinks I'll forget. But penguins? We remember EVERYTHING. I've been keeping a list since 2019."

NARRATOR: "He waddles toward the elevator. Every step calculated. Every flipper swing deliberate. This is personal."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "I know she's in that meeting room. The one with the broken AC. She'll be vulnerable. Sweaty. Distracted."

NARRATOR: "The elevator dings. Third floor. Enemy territory."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "I'm going in."

NARRATOR: "He spots his target through the glass. Karen. Surrounded by her PowerPoint presentation and lukewarm coffee."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "There. On her desk. MY stapler. The red Swingline. She's had it for THREE WEEKS. That's 504 hours of injustice."

NARRATOR: "He approaches the door. His flippers tremble—not with fear, but with righteous fury."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "I could just knock and ask politely. But where's the satisfaction in that? No. This requires strategy. Psychological warfare."

INTERN: "Uh, sir? Are you talking to yourself?"

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "I'm being FILMED for a DOCUMENTARY, Brad! This is IMPORTANT!"

NARRATOR: "Brad retreats. He knows better than to interfere with a penguin on a mission."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "Okay. Focus. I'm going to waddle in there, make direct eye contact, and take what's MINE. And then—and THIS is the brilliant part—I'm going to eat her yogurt from the communal fridge."

NARRATOR: "The stakes have never been higher."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "The strawberry one. The GOOD one. The one she labeled 'KAREN - DO NOT TOUCH.'"

NARRATOR: "He enters the conference room. Time slows. Karen looks up."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "Hello, Karen. Nice presentation. Is that clip art from 2007? Anyway, I'm reclaiming my property."

NARRATOR: "He seizes the stapler. Victory is within his grasp—"

KAREN: "That's MY stapler. Yours is on YOUR desk where you LEFT it."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "...what."

NARRATOR: "Plot twist. M. Night Shyamalan couldn't have written it better."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "But... but I checked my desk! It wasn't—"

KAREN: "You checked the LEFT side. It's been on the RIGHT side for three weeks. I saw you looking for it every day and didn't say anything because I thought you'd figure it out."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "..."

NARRATOR: "Our hero realizes he's been the villain all along."

VINDICTIVE PENGUIN: "I ate your yogurt this morning."

KAREN: "I KNEW IT WAS YOU!"
