# Today's Improv (2026-02-20)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 69**

A deranged spider leads a cloud safety seminar for an excited beetle and a berserk dragon who are each completely convinced that nothing in the sky can hurt them.

---

DERANGED SPIDER: "Welcome to Cloud Safety 101. Today's topics: fall prevention, lightning protocols, and why 'I'll probably be fine' is not a risk assessment."

EXCITED BEETLE: "Oh! Oh! I already know everything! I fell off a cloud last Tuesday and I'm COMPLETELY FINE!"

BERSERK DRAGON: "SAFETY IS FOR THE WEAK. I AM THE DANGER."

DERANGED SPIDER: "That is the exact attitude that made this seminar mandatory. Slide one: clouds are not solid."

EXCITED BEETLE: "Wait— they're NOT? I've been sleeping on one for six months!"

BERSERK DRAGON: "I know they're not solid. I fly through them. On purpose. For fun."

DERANGED SPIDER: "Slide two: lightning is not a friend."

BERSERK DRAGON: "Lightning and I have an understanding. It hits me. I hit back. We respect each other."

EXCITED BEETLE: "I waved at lightning once! I think it was just being shy!"

DERANGED SPIDER: *twitching all eight eyes simultaneously* "It was not being shy. It was 40,000 volts."

EXCITED BEETLE: "That's just a big number for 'very enthusiastic'!"

BERSERK DRAGON: "Can we skip to the certificate part? I already know I'm passing."

DERANGED SPIDER: "There IS no certificate! This is mandatory REMEDIAL training because you BOTH fell off a cloud last week!"

EXCITED BEETLE: "It was more of a tumble! Very fun! Would strongly recommend!"

BERSERK DRAGON: "I didn't fall. I launched myself at a lower cloud that was being overconfident. I wanted to humble it."

DERANGED SPIDER: *scribbling furiously on notepad* "New slide. 'Do not attack clouds.'"

EXCITED BEETLE: "Ooh! When do we get to the lightning-riding module?!"

DERANGED SPIDER: "THERE IS NO LIGHTNING-RIDING MODULE."

EXCITED BEETLE: "Oh, there should be! I tried it last Thursday! Incredibly exhilarating!"

DERANGED SPIDER: "HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?!"

EXCITED BEETLE: "I bounced off a cloud on the way down! Clouds are SO forgiving once you get to know them!"

BERSERK DRAGON: *raising one enormous claw* "Permission to be excused. I need to challenge a thunderstorm to a staring contest."

DERANGED SPIDER: "I became a park ranger to PROTECT wildlife. And yet here we are."

BERSERK DRAGON: "I've filed my seminar review. Zero stars. Safety is cowardly." *flies directly into a storm cloud*

*A tremendous crack of thunder echoes through the sky*

EXCITED BEETLE: "Ooh! Do you think they made a friend?!"

DERANGED SPIDER: *slowly rolls up safety poster* "I am switching careers."
