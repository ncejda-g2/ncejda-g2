A gourmet dragon encounters a cursed woman trapped by a hurricane in a volcano

---

GOURMET DRAGON: "Ah, finally! A nice quiet volcano to prepare my seven-course lava-seared tasting menu. Now, where did I put my truffle oil?"

CURSED WOMAN: "*being swirled around by magical hurricane winds* EXCUSE ME! A LITTLE HELP HERE?!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "*adjusts tiny chef's hat* I'm sorry, are you interrupting my mise en place? This soufflé waits for no one, not even hurricane victims."

CURSED WOMAN: "I've been CURSED! This hurricane has been following me for THREE DAYS! I can't even go to the bathroom without Category 5 winds!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "*sniffs disapprovingly* A hurricane? In MY volcano? Do you have any idea what that's doing to the ambient temperature? I need exactly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for my crème brûlée!"

CURSED WOMAN: "ARE YOU SERIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT DESSERT RIGHT NOW?!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "Dessert is NEVER 'just' anything, madam. It's the crescendo of the meal, the final movement of a culinary symphony! Also, your hurricane is blowing ash into my beurre blanc and it's becoming gritty."

CURSED WOMAN: "*spinning faster* How are you not being affected by these winds?!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "I weigh four tons and have scales. What's your excuse for not being heavier? Clearly you don't appreciate the finer things in life."

CURSED WOMAN: "The witch who cursed me said I'd be trapped in eternal wind prison until I learned 'the value of stillness'! I've tried yoga! I've tried meditation! Nothing works!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "*pauses from dicing shallots with claw* Did you try... waiting for the pasta water to boil without checking it constantly?"

CURSED WOMAN: "What? No! Why would—"

GOURMET DRAGON: "AH-HAH! There's your problem! Stillness isn't about sitting cross-legged on a mountain, darling. It's about the discipline to let your risotto rest for EXACTLY three minutes before serving. To let your steak come to room temperature before searing. To let the wine breathe!"

CURSED WOMAN: "That's... that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! This is a MAGICAL CURSE, not a cooking show!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "*flambés something dramatically* Is it though? Magic and cooking are basically the same. You combine ingredients, follow ancient instructions, hope nothing explodes, and if you rush it, EVERYTHING IS RUINED!"

CURSED WOMAN: "I don't have TIME for your culinary philosophy! I'm running out of spin cycle here!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "Fine, fine. Hold still—well, as still as you can while being a human tornado—and taste this."

CURSED WOMAN: "Taste what? How am I supposed to—"

GOURMET DRAGON: "*expertly tosses a small chocolate truffle into the hurricane, which deposits it directly in her mouth*"

CURSED WOMAN: "*suddenly the hurricane stops* Oh my god. What... what IS that?"

GOURMET DRAGON: "Dark chocolate ganache with volcanic sea salt and a hint of patience. I let it temper for six hours. SIX. HOURS. Without touching it. Without peeking. Just... trusting the process."

CURSED WOMAN: "*standing on solid ground for the first time in days* The curse... it's broken. I'm FREE! But also, do you have more of those chocolates?"

GOURMET DRAGON: "Of course. But you'll have to wait twenty minutes while I plate them properly. Good things come to those who wait."

CURSED WOMAN: "You know what? After three days in a hurricane, I can wait twenty minutes."

GOURMET DRAGON: "Excellent. You're learning. Now, would you like to stay for dinner? I'm making roasted phoenix with a pomegranate reduction. The phoenix regenerates, so it's sustainable AND delicious."

CURSED WOMAN: "Is that... ethical?"

GOURMET DRAGON: "The phoenix literally asked me to. It says being delicious is its purpose in life. Who am I to deny it?"

CURSED WOMAN: "This is the weirdest day of my life, and I spent half of it in a supernatural weather event."

GOURMET DRAGON: "Welcome to fine dining, darling. Also, you're doing dishes. My sous chef quit after the molten rock incident."

CURSED WOMAN: "There was a molten rock incident?!"

GOURMET DRAGON: "He rushed the reduction. I told him to be patient. He did not listen. Now he's a statue in the east corridor. Very tragic. Also, very good décor."

CURSED WOMAN: "...I'll be very careful with the dishes."

GOURMET DRAGON: "See? You're learning stillness already. Now, chop these onions. And cry quietly—your tears will over-salt the soup."
