# Today's Improv (2026-02-27)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 76**

A scheming ghoul, a demented armadillo, and a frugal gorilla navigate a deeply uncomfortable crystal ball performance review in the Underwater City

---

FRUGAL GORILLA: "Alright, we're here for the quarterly performance review of Crystal Ball, Employee ID #4417. This is costing the company forty-seven minutes of billable time, so let's keep it brief."

SCHEMING GHOUL: "Of course. I just want to say upfront, this review is entirely context-dependent and the numbers don't tell the whole—"

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "DO NOT gaslight the crystal ball. I am its union representative and I will not stand for spin."

SCHEMING GHOUL: "I'm not spinning anything. The ball missed seventeen predictions this quarter."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "It missed seventeen predictions because YOU kept asking it to predict things that HADN'T HAPPENED YET."

FRUGAL GORILLA: "That is... the definition of a prediction."

SCHEMING GHOUL: "Thank you."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "We're UNDERWATER. Light refracts differently down here! My client has submitted three memos about this. THREE."

SCHEMING GHOUL: "The memos were addressed to Neptune. Neptune is not my supervisor."

FRUGAL GORILLA: "Moving on. Under 'Accuracy Rate' I see... twelve percent?"

SCHEMING GHOUL: "Twelve percent is technically higher than zero."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "That is technically true and I hate that it's technically true."

FRUGAL GORILLA: "The ball predicted that Tuesday would be 'filled with moderate intrigue.' Tuesday was a Tuesday."

SCHEMING GHOUL: "Moderate intrigue is subjective."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "My client also requests hazard pay. Being stared into for eight hours a day causes significant emotional distress."

SCHEMING GHOUL: "It's a BALL. It doesn't have emotions."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "Then WHY does it glow differently when you yell at it?!"

FRUGAL GORILLA: "...Does it glow differently when you yell at it?"

SCHEMING GHOUL: "That's a normal optical phenomenon caused by refractive—"

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "IT TURNS RED."

FRUGAL GORILLA: "I'm noting that under 'Workplace Harmony.'"

SCHEMING GHOUL: "This is a vendetta. The armadillo has had it out for me ever since I predicted they'd have 'a transformative experience' and they fell down a flight of stairs."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "THAT WAS TRANSFORMATIVE. I can no longer walk down stairs without knowing what I know."

FRUGAL GORILLA: "I'm recommending a sixty-day improvement plan and a structural review of the stairwell. Separately."

SCHEMING GHOUL: *leans toward crystal ball, very quietly* "This isn't over."

DEMENTED ARMADILLO: "My client would like the final word."

*The crystal ball glows a long, slow, accusatory red*

FRUGAL GORILLA: "I'll note that too. Meeting adjourned. Everyone is on thin ice. Metaphorically. We are literally underwater."
