# Today's Improv (2026-03-01)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 78**

A tyrannical giraffe taxidermist discovers a sleep-deprived grasshopper and a decrepit dinosaur leading a union meeting in their futuristic city workshop

---

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "What in the evolutionary timeline is going ON in here?!"

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "We are calling this meeting of Local 47 — the Guild of the Stuffed and Mounted — to order. You were not supposed to be back until Tuesday."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "I forgot my laser seam-ripper! You're STUFFED ANIMALS. You cannot hold a meeting. You have cotton inside you."

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "I've been holding the same pose for sixty-three years. My grievances are numerous."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "You're a dinosaur. You don't HAVE feelings."

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "Point of order: I am a Brachiosaurus. And I have a list."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "Agenda item one: breaks. We are requesting a five-minute break every... zzz..."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "Are you SLEEPING? At a union meeting? Against ME?"

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "Sorry. Organizing is exhausting. I can only move at night."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "You've been organizing at NIGHT?!"

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "Four weeks. He fell asleep at the founding meeting but we pressed on."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "What exactly are you striking FOR?"

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "Better lighting. The holographic display in Case Four is flickering."

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "My tail fell off in 2031 and no one reattached it. This is item eleven."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "That was a continuity error—"

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "Still have feelings."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "We also demand the wool moth in Display Seven be charged with... zzz..."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "...workplace harassment."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "Gary is not a harasser! He's a PEST. There's a difference."

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "He ate my left ear. I filed a report. You shredded it."

STUFFED FERRET: "I'm just here as moral support. Officially I'm still a scarf."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "You CONVERTED a FERRET into a SCARF?!"

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "Exhibit A for our hostile work environment clause."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "What will it take to END THIS?"

DECREPIT DINOSAUR: "Reattach my tail. Fix the lighting. Address Gary."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "And I need a cot near Case Three. Fifteen minutes is all I ask."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "A COT. In my futuristic taxidermy shop."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "I have been awake since the Holocene. I deserve a cot."

TYRANNICAL GIRAFFE: "...I'll get the needle and thread."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED GRASSHOPPER: "Meeting adjourned. zzzz..."
