# Today's Improv (2026-02-28)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 77**

A down-to-earth giraffe and an absurd giraffe wrestle with cryptocurrency in the jungle as a catastrophic dragon invests heavily on a dream pelican's advice

---

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "Alright, think of it like iron ore. You mine for it, you smelt it, you end up with something valuable."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "So cryptocurrency is a sword?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "No. There's no sword. You get... digital coins."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "Digital. So they're invisible swords."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "They're not swords. Imagine a ledger. A big book that everyone can see."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "I ate a ledger once. It tasted of nothing and regret."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "This one's on the internet. It tracks who owns what."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "Can you shoe a horse with it?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "You cannot shoe a horse with cryptocurrency."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "Then I question its value."

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "Did someone say CRYPTOCURRENCY?!"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "I specifically did not invite you."

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "I have forty percent of my hoard in CoinDragon. It's up fourteen hundred percent. I'm RICH."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "Where did you hear about CoinDragon?"

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "A pelican told me in a dream. He had a very professional tie. Very trustworthy."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "Cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value. It's speculative. It could go to zero."

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "Impossible. The pelican promised."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "If it goes to zero, is that like melting a sword back into ore?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "That is genuinely the most accurate thing anyone has ever said about a market crash."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "What if the blockchain is just a very long sword?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "It is not a sword."

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "CoinDragon is down sixty percent. It's fine. It's a dip. I'M BUYING THE DIP."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "Do not buy the dip."

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "I BOUGHT THE DIP. NOW IT'S DOWN EIGHTY PERCENT."

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "I was a blacksmith. I knew what iron was. Iron was iron."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "And now?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "Now I'm explaining imaginary coins to a giraffe who thinks everything is a sword and a dragon who takes investment advice from dream pelicans."

CATASTROPHIC DRAGON: "For the record, the pelican seemed very credible."

ABSURD GIRAFFE: "Can we make a sword out of the pelican?"

DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRAFFE: "I'll get the forge."
