# Today's Improv (2025-12-18)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 5**

A rockstar unicorn, a rotund chicken, and a diligent armadillo find themselves in a volcano where an aging butler fights for her inheritance

---

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "*shredding air guitar on horn* DUDES! This volcano is the PERFECT venue for my comeback tour! The acoustics are INSANE!"

AGING BUTLER: "*clutching a scroll of inheritance documents* For the last time, this is NOT a concert venue! This is the reading of Lady Vesuvius's will, and I am her RIGHTFUL heir!"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "*fanning self with wing* It's too hot for drama, Gladys. Also, why are we having a will reading IN an actual volcano? Couldn't we do this at a nice air-conditioned lawyer's office?"

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "*taking notes methodically* According to the documents, Lady Vesuvius specifically requested her will be read 'in the heart of Mount Krakatoa, where the lava flows freely and the dramatic lighting is optimal.' Section 3, paragraph 7."

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "YEAH! The lady had TASTE! *plays power chord on horn* This place ROCKS! Literally!"

AGING BUTLER: "I served Lady Vesuvius for FORTY-THREE YEARS! I ironed her capes! I polished her collection of cursed amulets! I pretended not to notice when she turned dinner guests into newts!"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "Okay, but did you READ the will? Because I'm the executor, and there's a... situation."

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "*adjusting reading glasses* The will states, and I quote: 'To my faithful butler Gladys, I leave my entire fortune... IF and ONLY IF she can rock out harder than any unicorn present at the reading.'"

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "*stops mid-riff* Wait, WHAT?!"

AGING BUTLER: "That's... that's preposterous! I'm seventy-six years old! I have sciatica!"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "Lady Vesuvius was very specific. She said, 'Gladys has been uptight for four decades. It's time she learned to let loose or let go.'"

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "There's also a clause that if the butler refuses, the entire estate goes to 'whoever can prove they're the most metal creature in the volcano.' Currently, the unicorn is the front-runner."

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "*preening* I mean, I DO have a glitter mane and I once played a solo so sick that Mount Olympus erupted. Not bragging, just facts."

AGING BUTLER: "*voice cracking* But... but I don't know how to rock out! I know how to fold napkins into swans! I know seventeen different ways to serve tea!"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "Then I guess the unicorn gets the seven million dollars, the castle, and the collection of enchanted Elvis memorabilia."

AGING BUTLER: "ENCHANTED ELVIS MEMORABILIA?! Lady Vesuvius promised me those! I helped her steal them from Graceland in 1977!"

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "*flipping through papers* It says here you were the getaway driver. Very impressive for a butler."

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "Look, Gladys, I'll be honest—I don't even WANT the money. I just came because the invitation said there'd be punch and dramatic volcanic backdrops. But if you want to beat me, you gotta FEEL it! *stomps hoof* Channel your inner rebel!"

AGING BUTLER: "*stiffly* I don't... I don't have an inner rebel."

ROTUND CHICKEN: "Oh, PLEASE. You stole Elvis's stuff from Graceland. You served a witch for forty-three years. You're standing in a VOLCANO right now and you're not even sweating. You're metal as hell, Gladys."

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "Statistically speaking, butlers who work for chaotic evil employers have a 94% higher tolerance for insanity than the general population. You've got this."

AGING BUTLER: "*looking at the lava, then at the scroll, then at the unicorn* Lady Vesuvius always said I needed to 'embrace the chaos'..."

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "That's the SPIRIT! Here, borrow my horn. It's wireless and has seventeen whammy bar settings."

AGING BUTLER: "*taking the horn hesitantly* I can't believe I'm doing this. If my mother could see me now—"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "Your mother is literally watching from that portrait. I saw it wink."

AGING BUTLER: "*suddenly possessed by decades of repressed rock energy* ALRIGHT, YOU WANT METAL?! *strikes power chord that causes the volcano to rumble* I SERVED LADY VESUVIUS THROUGH THREE DEMONIC POSSESSIONS, TWO APOCALYPSES, AND A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PHASE WHERE SHE ONLY SPOKE IN HAIKUS! I EARNED THAT ELVIS COLLECTION!"

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "*impressed* Oh my. The lava is... dancing?"

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "*headbanging enthusiastically* YEAH, GLADYS! SHRED IT!"

AGING BUTLER: "*getting into it* AND ANOTHER THING! *riffs intensify* I AM TIRED OF FOLDING NAPKINS! I AM TIRED OF SAYING 'YES, M'LADY'! I WANT TO WEAR LEATHER JACKETS AND EAT CEREAL FOR DINNER!"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "*wiping away a tear* She's finally free..."

AGING BUTLER: "*one final epic solo that causes the volcano to shoot fireworks* AND I AM KEEPING THE ELVIS STUFF! *drops horn, which lands perfectly upright*"

*Silence. Even the lava seems stunned.*

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "*slow clap* Okay. You win. That was the most metal thing I've ever seen, and I once saw a dragon eat a motorcycle."

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "*stamping documents* The will is satisfied. Congratulations, Gladys. You are now the proud owner of a seven-million-dollar estate, one haunted castle, and a leisure suit worn by Elvis in 1973 that may or may not grant wishes."

AGING BUTLER: "*breathing heavily* Did I just... did I just rock out in a volcano?"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "You didn't just rock out. You DESTROYED. I got that whole thing on video. We could sell it to MTV. Do they still exist?"

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "Gladys, I gotta say—you've got TALENT. Ever thought about joining a band? I'm starting a supergroup called 'The Elderly and the Furious.'"

AGING BUTLER: "*straightening her uniform, but with a new swagger* Mr. Unicorn, I have forty-three years of repressed rage and a newly acquired fortune. I'll think about it."

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "Also, according to footnote 47, there's a bonus clause: 'If Gladys rocks out successfully, she also gets my motorcycle collection.' There are fourteen motorcycles. All enchanted."

AGING BUTLER: "*eyes lighting up* Enchanted motorcycles, you say?"

ROTUND CHICKEN: "Oh no. She's got the look. The 'I'm about to do something wild' look."

AGING BUTLER: "*picking up the horn again* Gentlemen. And chicken. And armadillo. Let's take this show on the road. LITERALLY."

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! *high-hoofs Gladys* WORLD TOUR 2025! BUTLER'S REVENGE!"

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "*already drafting tour contracts* I'll need everyone to initial here, here, and here. Also, we'll need insurance. Volcanic insurance is surprisingly affordable."

ROTUND CHICKEN: "I'll be the tour manager. Someone's gotta make sure you lunatics eat vegetables."

AGING BUTLER: "*revving an invisible motorcycle* Lady Vesuvius, wherever you are... thank you for the weird, weird gift."

*A ghostly voice echoes through the volcano: "YOU'RE WELCOME, GLADYS. ALSO, YOU'RE FIRED. GO LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE."*

ROCKSTAR UNICORN: "Did the volcano just—"

DILIGENT ARMADILLO: "Let's not question it. I've learned not to question things in this job."
