# Today's Improv (2026-02-18)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 67**

A frazzled gorilla and a punk horse work as medieval heralds announcing tweets in Ye Olde English to a confused modern audience at an amusement park.

---

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "Hear ye, hear ye! A proclamation from... uh... @BratSummer2024: 'Brat summer is literally so over I can't even.'"

PUNK HORSE: "Dude, you're doing it wrong. More flowery. Watch this— HARK! The lady @BratSummer2024 doth declare with great lamentations that the season of Brat hath concluded most grievously!"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "I've been doing this for six hours! My throat hurts! Why did we take this gig at an amusement park?"

PUNK HORSE: "Because 'Medieval Tweet Herald' sounded punk rock on the job posting. It's subversive! We're mocking both medieval times AND social media!"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "No one understands what we're saying! That family just asked if we're having a stroke!"

PUNK HORSE: "Art is supposed to make people uncomfortable, man. Next tweet—"

RANDOM TEEN: "Excuse me, can you just... stop? We're trying to ride the Tilt-A-Whirl."

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "We have 847 more tweets to announce today! The algorithm demands it!"

PUNK HORSE: "SILENCE, PEASANT! Hear ye: @RizzKing posts thusly: 'Just took the fattest L at chipotle, they forgot my guac 💀💀💀'"

TEEN: "What does that even mean in old English?"

PUNK HORSE: "Lo! The sovereign of Rizz hath suffered a most CATASTROPHIC defeat at the establishment of Chipotle! His sacred avocado paste hath been FORSAKEN by the merchants most cruel!"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "Why are we doing the skull emojis verbally?"

PUNK HORSE: "I said 'most cruel.' That's basically three skull emojis."

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "I need a break. My medieval voice is slipping. Listen— *clears throat* —Hark, a missive from @DogMomLife: 'My fur baby just—' I can't. I cannot announce this tweet about a labradoodle eating socks."

PUNK HORSE: "You're breaking character! We took an OATH to the Social Media Renaissance Faire Company!"

AMUSEMENT PARK MANAGER: *walks up* "Hey, we're getting complaints. Apparently you announced someone's breakup tweet and their ex was in line for churros."

PUNK HORSE: "Verily, 'twas a public post!"

MANAGER: "You described it as 'a most treacherous wench hath betrayed the noble Chad.'"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "That's... actually what the tweet said though?"

MANAGER: "Chad is eleven years old and his girlfriend just moved to Ohio!"

PUNK HORSE: "A tale of woe spanning kingdoms!"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "I'm having a breakdown. Do you know what the next tweet is? It's from @CryptoLion42: 'GM. WAGMI. LFG.' How do I make that medieval?!"

PUNK HORSE: "Easy— 'Good morrow! Whilst All shall Gaineth Much Income! Let us Forth Go!'"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "That's not even close to correct!"

PUNK HORSE: "Neither is cryptocurrency but here we are!"

MANAGER: "You're both fired. Please return your trumpets and feathered hats."

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "Oh thank god. I can finally stop pretending I understand Middle English."

PUNK HORSE: "This is censorship! You're silencing the voice of the digital town crier!"

MANAGER: "You announced a flamingo's thirst trap selfie as 'a painted lady doth display her plumage most scandalously.'"

PUNK HORSE: "...That flamingo knew what she was doing."

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "I'm going home. I need to lie down for seven years."

PUNK HORSE: "FORSOOTH! Thou art a COWARD! A KNAVE! A—"

FRAZZLED GORILLA: "Dude, we literally got fired. The performance is over."

PUNK HORSE: "Fine. But for the record, this would've been sick content if anyone understood what a herald was."
