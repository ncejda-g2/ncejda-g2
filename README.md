# Today's Improv (2026-02-21)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 70**

A philosophical pangolin leads a corporate trust fall retreat aboard a space station, where a hyperactive angel and a cheerful owl discover that trust in zero gravity has catastrophic and deeply enlightening consequences.

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "Welcome to the trust fall workshop. Before we begin, I want it on record that I have concerns. Many concerns. Also, who authorized this location?"

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: "I LOVE IT HERE! I've already done fourteen laps of the module! Everything is CURVED!"

CHEERFUL OWL: "Good morning! I've been practicing my falling face! Would you like to see it?"

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "Trust. A loaded word. Who among us truly trusts anyone? And more importantly, who is monitoring the emergency hatch?"

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: *raising both wings wildly* "ME! There are four exits plus a hatch I'm definitely not supposed to open but I really want to!"

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "The exercise is simple. You fall backward. Your partner catches you. You briefly accept that the universe is not purely adversarial."

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: "I'LL GO FIRST! SOMEONE CATCH ME RIGHT NOW!"

*HYPERACTIVE ANGEL launches backward at tremendous velocity and vanishes down the module*

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "I hadn't finished the safety—"

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: *from very far away* "CAUGHT THE WALL! THE WALL IS AN EXCELLENT TRUST PARTNER!"

CHEERFUL OWL: "Ten out of ten! Incredible commitment to the fall!"

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: *writing in notepad* "Note: wall is not a trust partner. Ceiling is not a trust partner. The hatch is absolutely not a trust partner."

CHEERFUL OWL: "Can I go next? I've perfected my serene expression." *demonstrates an expression of unnerving, radiant joy*

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "That is genuinely alarming and we are not ready."

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: *zooming back in upside down* "Okay okay OKAY, I'll catch you this time! For real! I've been training! I lift halos!"

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "...Fine. Someone must model trust. Even if trust is a social construct designed to lower our defenses."

*PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN falls backward with philosophical reluctance*

*HYPERACTIVE ANGEL catches them, then immediately launches both of them into the ceiling*

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR."

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: "THIS IS TRUST PLUS! WE'RE FLYING AND ALSO TRUSTING!"

CHEERFUL OWL: *scribbling on feedback form* "Five stars. Would fall again. Highly recommend the ceiling."

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: *floating serenely against the ceiling* "I trusted exactly one time. This is the result."

HYPERACTIVE ANGEL: "Doesn't that kind of prove trust works, though?"

*A long pause*

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "...I need a moment to process that."

CHEERFUL OWL: "Take all the time you need! Meanwhile, I've set up the blindfolded zero-gravity maze!"

PHILOSOPHICAL PANGOLIN: "I am going to fall directly into the sun."
