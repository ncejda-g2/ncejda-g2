*Calligraphy exam: Write down the number 37, spelled out, nicely.*

### The 3-Panel Story

**Panel 1:** A brave giraffe walks confidently into a calligraphy exam, clutching a tiny brush in its mouth. The instructor eyes the giraffe's impossibly long neck nervously and says, "Write the number 37, spelled out, beautifully."

**Panel 2:** The giraffe begins writing with exquisite penmanship, but due to its 6-foot neck, there's a significant delay between its brain and the brush. By the time it finishes, it has accidentally written "thirty-seven-ty-seven-teen-seven."

**Panel 3:** The instructor stares at the 40-foot-long scroll of calligraphy containing 127 sevens in perfect script. "This is either the worst answer or the most avant-garde commentary on mathematical anxiety I've ever seen. A+." The giraffe faints from pride, its neck accordion-folding across three zip codes.
