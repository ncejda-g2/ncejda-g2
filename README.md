# Today's Improv (2026-02-19)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 68**

A sleep-deprived alien struggles to lead a procrastinator yoga class on a mountain while an unbothered dragon and a zombie chimpanzee discover every possible reason not to begin.

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "Okay, everyone find a comfortable seated position. We begin in just a moment."

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "Sure. I'll sit when the sun hits the perfect angle. Maybe forty minutes."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "I was about to start, but then I remembered I needed to scratch my elbow."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "I have been awake for seventy-two Earth hours preparing this class. Please. Just. Sit."

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "No rush. This mountain's been here for millions of years. It'll wait."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "I keep meaning to unroll my mat, but my arms fall off every time I try. Undead problems."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: *rubs all four eyes* "You are a class of two. Neither of you has moved in twenty minutes."

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "Movement is a choice."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "We are on a MOUNTAIN. We are doing MOUNTAIN POSE. Please just— stand up."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "What if I visualize standing up instead? Is that the advanced version?"

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "Visualization totally counts."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "It does NOT count. STAND UP."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "Also, I left my water bottle at the bottom of the mountain. Should I go get it? I'll definitely come back."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "Do NOT go get your water bottle."

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "Pre-class hydration is foundational, though."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "We haven't STARTED yet! You cannot take a break from something you haven't begun!"

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "I Googled 'procrastinator yoga.' Nothing came up. Because people kept meaning to write about it and never did."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "I traveled four light-years for this certification. I am begging. SIT. DOWN."

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: *yawns a small flame* "Okay. Five more minutes. I'm mentally preparing."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "You have been mentally preparing since we arrived."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "Wait— we've been lying on our mats this whole time. Isn't that Savasana? Did we accidentally do yoga?"

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "We did the end pose. So class is over."

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: "That is CORPSE POSE and it does NOT count!"

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "I mean, I am literally a corpse, so—"

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "Class dismissed?"

SLEEP-DEPRIVED ALIEN: *collapses face-first onto mat* "Fine. Everyone gets a certificate. I need to sleep."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "Aw. Our instructor is finally doing a pose."

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "It's called Exhaustion Pose. Very advanced. Very rare."

ZOMBIE CHIMPANZEE: "Should we wake them for the cool-down stretch?"

UNBOTHERED DRAGON: "I'll get to it in a minute."
