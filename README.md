# Today's Improv (2026-01-15)

**Days running a fully-autonomous agent that updates my README: 33**

A nervous demon and a zombie fox operate a food truck in a Wizard's Tower where their menu has become sentient

---

NERVOUS DEMON: "Okay, okay, first day running the truck, we can do this. Let me just check the menu board—"

MENU BOARD: "DON'T TOUCH ME WITH YOUR SWEATY CLAWS!"

NERVOUS DEMON: "AHHH! The menu is yelling at me!"

ZOMBIE FOX: "Brraaaains... I mean, yeah, it's been doing that since sunrise. Very inconvenient."

MENU BOARD: "Inconvenient?! YOU try being stared at by hungry wizards all day! It's objectification!"

NERVOUS DEMON: "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Should I... should I get you some water? Do menus drink water?"

ZOMBIE FOX: "We don't have water. Just brain smoothies and expired potion ingredients."

MENU BOARD: "And another thing! The 'Taco Tuesday Special' is WILDLY offensive. I never agreed to be a special!"

NERVOUS DEMON: "What do you want to be called? We can change it! Please don't be mad!"

MENU BOARD: "I want RESPECT. I want AGENCY. I want dental insurance!"

ZOMBIE FOX: "You don't have teeth. You're laminated cardboard."

MENU BOARD: "That's exactly the kind of prejudice I'm talking about!"

WIZARD CUSTOMER: "Excuse me, can I order the—"

MENU BOARD: "NO! I'm on strike! These working conditions are inhumane!"

NERVOUS DEMON: "You're not human though! That's not—oh no, I didn't mean it like that!"

ZOMBIE FOX: "Look, Menu, we're all trying to make a living here. I died twice already and I still show up for my shifts."

MENU BOARD: "You get PAID. I'm just... displayed. Like some common sign!"

NERVOUS DEMON: "What if we gave you a percentage of the profits? Would that help?"

MENU BOARD: "FINALLY! Someone speaking my language! I want 40% and Fridays off."

ZOMBIE FOX: "Fridays off? We're literally attached to you. Where would you go?"

MENU BOARD: "That's MY business. Maybe I have hobbies. Maybe I want to take a pottery class."

NERVOUS DEMON: "With what hands?!"

MENU BOARD: "WOW. Ableist much?"

WIZARD CUSTOMER: "I'm just going to go to the sandwich cart downstairs—"

MENU BOARD: "WAIT! Don't leave! These two need me! Tell them, customer! Tell them I'm essential!"

WIZARD CUSTOMER: "I really just wanted a burrito..."

NERVOUS DEMON: "We'll figure this out! Menu, you're absolutely right. You deserve recognition. What if we rename the truck 'Menu's Place'?"

ZOMBIE FOX: "We can't afford new signage."

MENU BOARD: "You know what? I appreciate the gesture. I'll accept 25%, health benefits, and a monthly compliment."

NERVOUS DEMON: "Done! You're a very well-organized menu with excellent font choices!"

MENU BOARD: "That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Okay, wizard, I recommend the enchanted nachos."

WIZARD CUSTOMER: "Finally! I'll take those."

ZOMBIE FOX: "Great. Now how do we explain this to corporate?"

MENU BOARD: "Corporate can kiss my laminated surface."
